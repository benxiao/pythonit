SERVANT
FR
ST
ALBAN
OF
TRUTH
WHAT
IS
TRUTH
SAID
JESTING
PILATE
AND
WOULD
NOT
STAY
FOR
AN
ANSWER
CERTAINLY
THERE
BE
THAT
DELIGHT
IN
GIDDINESS
AND
COUNT
IT
BONDAGE
TO
FIX
BELIEF
AFFECTING
FREE
WILL
IN
THINKING
AS
WELL
AS
IN
ACTING
AND
THOUGH
THE
SECTS
OF
PHILOSOPHERS
OF
THAT
KIND
BE
GONE
YET
THERE
REMAIN
CERTAIN
DISCOURSING
WITS
WHICH
ARE
OF
THE
SAME
VEINS
THOUGH
THERE
BE
NOT
SO
MUCH
BLOOD
IN
THEM
AS
WAS
IN
THOSE
OF
THE
ANCIENTS
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
ONLY
THE
DIFFICULTY
AND
LABOR
WHICH
MEN
TAKE
IN
FINDING
OUT
OF
TRUTH
NOR
AGAIN
THAT
WHEN
IT
IS
FOUND
IT
IMPOSETH
UPON
MEN
THOUGHTS
THAT
DOTH
BRING
LIES
IN
FAVOR
BUT
NATURAL
THOUGH
CORRUPT
LOVE
OF
THE
LIE
ITSELF
ONE
OF
THE
LATER
SCHOOL
OF
THE
GRECIANS
EXAMINETH
THE
MATTER
AND
IS
AT
STAND
TO
THINK
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
IN
IT
THAT
MEN
SHOULD
LOVE
LIES
WHERE
NEITHER
THEY
MAKE
FOR
PLEASURE
AS
WITH
POETS
NOR
FOR
ADVANTAGE
AS
WITH
THE
MERCHANT
BUT
FOR
THE
LIE
SAKE
BUT
CANNOT
TELL
THIS
SAME
TRUTH
IS
NAKED
AND
OPEN
DAY
LIGHT
THAT
DOTH
NOT
SHOW
THE
MASKS
AND
MUMMERIES
AND
TRIUMPHS
OF
THE
WORLD
HALF
SO
STATELY
AND
DAINTILY
AS
CANDLE
LIGHTS
TRUTH
MAY
PERHAPS
COME
TO
THE
PRICE
OF
PEARL
THAT
SHOWETH
BEST
BY
DAY
BUT
IT
WILL
NOT
RISE
TO
THE
PRICE
OF
DIAMOND
OR
CARBUNCLE
THAT
SHOWETH
BEST
IN
VARIED
LIGHTS
MIXTURE
OF
LIE
DOTH
EVER
ADD
PLEASURE
DOTH
ANY
MAN
DOUBT
THAT
IF
THERE
WERE
TAKEN
OUT
OF
MEN
MINDS
VAIN
OPINIONS
FLATTERING
HOPES
FALSE
VALUATIONS
IMAGINATIONS
AS
ONE
WOULD
AND
THE
LIKE
BUT
IT
WOULD
LEAVE
THE
MINDS
OF
NUMBER
OF
MEN
POOR
SHRUNKEN
THINGS
FULL
OF
MELANCHOLY
AND
INDISPOSITION
AND
UNPLEASING
TO
THEMSELVES
ONE
OF
THE
FATHERS
IN
GREAT
SEVERITY
CALLED
POESY
VINUM
DAEMONUM
BECAUSE
IT
FIRETH
THE
IMAGINATION
AND
YET
IT
IS
BUT
WITH
THE
SHADOW
OF
LIE
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
LIE
THAT
PASSETH
THROUGH
THE
MIND
BUT
THE
LIE
THAT
SINKETH
IN
AND
SETTLETH
IN
IT
THAT
DOTH
THE
HURT
SUCH
AS
WE
SPAKE
OF
BEFORE
BUT
HOWSOEVER
THESE
THINGS
ARE
THUS
IN
MEN
DEPRAVED
JUDGMENTS
AND
AFFECTIONS
YET
TRUTH
WHICH
ONLY
DOTH
JUDGE
ITSELF
TEACHETH
THAT
THE
INQUIRY
OF
TRUTH
WHICH
IS
THE
LOVE
MAKING
OR
WOOING
OF
IT
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
TRUTH
WHICH
IS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
IT
AND
THE
BELIEF
OF
TRUTH
WHICH
IS
THE
ENJOYING
OF
IT
IS
THE
SOVEREIGN
GOOD
OF
HUMAN
NATURE
THE
FIRST
CREATURE
OF
GOD
IN
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
DAYS
WAS
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
SENSE
THE
LAST
WAS
THE
LIGHT
OF
REASON
AND
HIS
SABBATH
WORK
EVER
SINCE
IS
THE
ILLUMINATION
OF
HIS
SPIRIT
FIRST
HE
BREATHED
LIGHT
UPON
THE
FACE
OF
THE
MATTER
OR
CHAOS
THEN
HE
BREATHED
LIGHT
INTO
THE
FACE
OF
MAN
AND
STILL
HE
BREATHETH
AND
INSPIRETH
LIGHT
INTO
THE
FACE
OF
HIS
CHOSEN
THE
POET
THAT
BEAUTIFIED
THE
SECT
THAT
WAS
OTHERWISE
INFERIOR
TO
THE
REST
SAITH
YET
EXCELLENTLY
WELL
IT
IS
PLEASURE
TO
STAND
UPON
THE
SHORE
AND
TO
SEE
SHIPS
TOSSED
UPON
THE
SEA
PLEASURE
TO
STAND
IN
THE
WINDOW
OF
CASTLE
AND
TO
SEE
BATTLE
AND
THE
ADVENTURES
THEREOF
BELOW
BUT
NO
PLEASURE
IS
COMPARABLE
TO
THE
STANDING
UPON
THE
VANTAGE
GROUND
OF
TRUTH
HILL
NOT
TO
BE
COMMANDED
AND
WHERE
THE
AIR
IS
ALWAYS
CLEAR
AND
SERENE
AND
TO
SEE
THE
ERRORS
AND
WANDERINGS
AND
MISTS
AND
TEMPESTS
IN
THE
VALE
BELOW
SO
ALWAYS
THAT
THIS
PROSPECT
BE
WITH
PITY
AND
NOT
WITH
SWELLING
OR
PRIDE
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
HEAVEN
UPON
EARTH
TO
HAVE
MAN
MIND
MOVE
IN
CHARITY
REST
IN
PROVIDENCE
AND
TURN
UPON
THE
POLES
OF
TRUTH
TO
PASS
FROM
THEOLOGICAL
AND
PHILOSOPHICAL
TRUTH
TO
THE
TRUTH
OF
CIVIL
BUSINESS
IT
WILL
BE
ACKNOWLEDGED
EVEN
BY
THOSE
THAT
PRACTISE
IT
NOT
THAT
CLEAR
AND
ROUND
DEALING
IS
THE
HONOR
OF
MAN
NATURE
AND
THAT
MIXTURE
OF
FALSEHOODS
IS
LIKE
ALLOY
IN
COIN
OF
GOLD
AND
SILVER
WHICH
MAY
MAKE
THE
METAL
WORK
THE
BETTER
BUT
IT
EMBASETH
IT
FOR
THESE
WINDING
AND
CROOKED
COURSES
ARE
THE
GOINGS
OF
THE
SERPENT
WHICH
GOETH
BASELY
UPON
THE
BELLY
AND
NOT
UPON
THE
FEET
THERE
IS
NO
VICE
THAT
DOTH
SO
COVER
MAN
WITH
SHAME
AS
TO
BE
FOUND
FALSE
AND
PERFIDIOUS
AND
THEREFORE
MONTAIGNE
SAITH
PRETTILY
WHEN
HE
INQUIRED
THE
REASON
WHY
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LIE
SHOULD
BE
SUCH
DISGRACE
AND
SUCH
AN
ODIOUS
CHARGE
SAITH
HE
IF
IT
BE
WELL
WEIGHED
TO
SAY
THAT
MAN
LIETH
IS
AS
MUCH
TO
SAY
AS
THAT
HE
IS
BRAVE
TOWARDS
GOD
AND
COWARD
TOWARDS
MEN
FOR
LIE
FACES
GOD
AND
SHRINKS
FROM
MAN
SURELY
THE
WICKEDNESS
OF
FALSEHOOD
AND
BREACH
OF
FAITH
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
BE
SO
HIGHLY
EXPRESSED
AS
IN
THAT
IT
SHALL
BE
THE
LAST
PEAL
TO
CALL
THE
JUDGMENTS
OF
GOD
UPON
THE
GENERATIONS
OF
MEN
IT
BEING
FORETOLD
THAT
WHEN
CHRIST
COMETH
HE
SHALL
NOT
FIND
FAITH
UPON
THE
EARTH
OF
DEATH
MEN
FEAR
DEATH
AS
CHILDREN
FEAR
TO
GO
IN
THE
DARK
AND
AS
THAT
NATURAL
FEAR
IN
CHILDREN
IS
INCREASED
WITH
TALES
SO
IS
THE
OTHER
CERTAINLY
THE
CONTEMPLATION
OF
DEATH
AS
THE
WAGES
OF
SIN
AND
PASSAGE
TO
ANOTHER
WORLD
IS
HOLY
AND
RELIGIOUS
BUT
THE
FEAR
OF
IT
AS
TRIBUTE
DUE
UNTO
NATURE
IS
WEAK
YET
IN
RELIGIOUS
MEDITATIONS
THERE
IS
SOMETIMES
MIXTURE
OF
VANITY
AND
OF
SUPERSTITION
YOU
SHALL
READ
IN
SOME
OF
THE
FRIARS
BOOKS
OF
MORTIFICATION
THAT
MAN
SHOULD
THINK
WITH
HIMSELF
WHAT
THE
PAIN
IS
IF
HE
HAVE
BUT
HIS
FINGER
END
PRESSED
OR
TORTURED
AND
THEREBY
IMAGINE
WHAT
THE
PAINS
OF
DEATH
ARE
WHEN
THE
WHOLE
BODY
IS
CORRUPTED
AND
DISSOLVED
WHEN
MANY
TIMES
DEATH
PASSETH
WITH
LESS
PAIN
THAN
THE
TORTURE
OF
LIMB
FOR
THE
MOST
VITAL
PARTS
ARE
NOT
THE
QUICKEST
OF
SENSE
AND
BY
HIM
THAT
SPAKE
ONLY
AS
PHILOSOPHER
AND
NATURAL
MAN
IT
WAS
WELL
SAID
POMPA
MORTIS
MAGIS
TERRET
QUAM
MORS
IPSA
GROANS
AND
CONVULSIONS
AND
DISCOLORED
FACE
AND
FRIENDS
WEEPING
AND
BLACKS
AND
OBSEQUIES
AND
THE
LIKE
SHOW
DEATH
TERRIBLE
IT
IS
WORTHY
THE
OBSERVING
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
PASSION
IN
THE
MIND
OF
MAN
SO
WEAK
BUT
IT
MATES
AND
MASTERS
THE
FEAR
OF
DEATH
AND
THEREFORE
DEATH
IS
NO
SUCH
TERRIBLE
ENEMY
WHEN
MAN
HATH
SO
MANY
ATTENDANTS
ABOUT
HIM
THAT
CAN
WIN
THE
COMBAT
OF
HIM
REVENGE
TRIUMPHS
OVER
DEATH
LOVE

IT
HONOR
ASPIRETH

IT
GRIEF
FLIETH

IT

AFTER
OTHO
THE
EMPEROR

SLAIN
HIMSELF

WHICH
IS
THE
TENDEREST
OF
AFFECTIONS
PROVOKED
MANY
TO

SAME
THING
SO
OFT
OVER
AND
OVER
IT
IS
NO
LESS
WORTHY
TO
OBSERVE
HOW
LITTLE
ALTERATION
IN
GOOD
SPIRITS
THE
APPROACHES
OF

MAKE
FOR
THEY
APPEAR
TO

AND

INFANT
PERHAPS
THE
ONE
IS
AS
PAINFUL
AS
THE
OTHER
HE
THAT
DIES
IN
AN
EARNEST
PURSUIT
IS

ONE
THAT
IS
WOUNDED
IN
HOT
BLOOD

TIME

HURT
AND
THEREFORE
MIND
FIXED
AND
BENT
UPON
SOMEWHAT
THAT
IS
GOOD
DOTH
AVERT
THE
DOLORS
OF
DEATH
BUT
ABOVE
ALL
BELIEVE
IT
THE
SWEETEST
CANTICLE
IS
NUNC
DIMITTIS
WHEN
MAN
HATH
OBTAINED
WORTHY
ENDS
AND
EXPECTATIONS
DEATH
HATH
THIS
ALSO
THAT
IT
OPENETH
THE
GATE
TO
GOOD
FAME
AND
EXTINGUISHETH
ENVY
EXTINCTUS
AMABITUR
IDEM
OF
UNITY
IN
RELIGION
RELIGION
BEING
THE
CHIEF
BAND
OF
HUMAN
SOCIETY
IT
IS
HAPPY
THING
WHEN
ITSELF
IS
WELL
CONTAINED
WITHIN
THE
TRUE
BAND
OF
UNITY
THE
QUARRELS
AND
DIVISIONS
ABOUT
RELIGION
WERE
EVILS
UNKNOWN
TO
THE
HEATHEN
THE
REASON
WAS
BECAUSE
THE
RELIGION
OF
THE
HEATHEN
CONSISTED
RATHER
IN
RITES
AND
CEREMONIES
THAN
IN
ANY
CONSTANT
BELIEF
FOR
YOU
MAY
IMAGINE
WHAT
KIND
OF
FAITH
THEIRS
WAS
WHEN
THE
CHIEF
DOCTORS
AND
FATHERS
OF
THEIR
CHURCH
WERE
THE
POETS
BUT
THE
TRUE
GOD
HATH
THIS
ATTRIBUTE
THAT
HE
IS
JEALOUS
GOD
AND
THEREFORE
HIS
WORSHIP
AND
RELIGION
WILL
ENDURE
NO
MIXTURE
NOR
PARTNER
WE
SHALL
THEREFORE
SPEAK
FEW
WORDS
CONCERNING
THE
UNITY
OF
THE
CHURCH
WHAT
ARE
THE
FRUITS
THEREOF
WHAT
THE
BOUNDS
AND
WHAT
THE
MEANS
THE
FRUITS
OF
UNITY
NEXT
UNTO
THE
WELL
PLEASING
OF
GOD
WHICH
IS
ALL
IN
ALL
ARE
TWO
THE
ONE
TOWARDS
THOSE
THAT
ARE
WITHOUT
THE
CHURCH
THE
OTHER
TOWARDS
THOSE
THAT
ARE
WITHIN
FOR
THE
FORMER
IT
IS
CERTAIN
THAT
HERESIES
AND
SCHISMS
ARE
OF
ALL
OTHERS
THE
GREATEST
SCANDALS
YEA
MORE
THAN
CORRUPTION
OF
MANNERS
FOR
AS
IN
THE
NATURAL
BODY
WOUND
OR
SOLUTION
OF
CONTINUITY
IS
WORSE
THAN
CORRUPT
HUMOR
SO
IN
THE
SPIRITUAL
SO
THAT
NOTHING
DOTH
SO
MUCH
KEEP
MEN
OUT
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
DRIVE
MEN
OUT
OF
THE
CHURCH
AS
BREACH
OF
UNITY
AND
THEREFORE
WHENSOEVER
IT
COMETH
TO
THAT
PASS
THAT
ONE
SAITH
ECCE
IN
DESERTO
ANOTHER
SAITH
ECCE
IN
PENETRALIBUS
THAT
IS
WHEN
SOME
MEN
SEEK
CHRIST
IN
THE
CONVENTICLES
OF
HERETICS
AND
OTHERS
IN
AN
OUTWARD
FACE
OF
CHURCH
THAT
VOICE
HAD
NEED
CONTINUALLY
TO
SOUND
IN
MEN
EARS
NOLITE
EXIRE
GO
NOT
OUT
THE
DOCTOR
OF
THE
GENTILES
THE
PROPRIETY
OF
WHOSE
VOCATION
DREW
HIM
TO
HAVE
SPECIAL
CARE
OF
THOSE
WITHOUT
SAITH
IF
AN
HEATHEN
COME
IN
AND
HEAR
YOU
SPEAK
WITH
SEVERAL
TONGUES
WILL
HE
NOT
SAY
THAT
YOU
ARE
MAD
AND
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
LITTLE
BETTER
WHEN
ATHEISTS
AND
PROFANE
PERSONS
DO
HEAR
OF
SO
MANY
DISCORDANT
AND
CONTRARY
OPINIONS
IN
RELIGION
IT
DOTH
AVERT
THEM
FROM
THE
CHURCH
AND
MAKETH
THEM
TO
SIT
DOWN
IN
THE
CHAIR
OF
THE
SCORNERS
IT
IS
BUT
LIGHT
THING
TO
BE
VOUCHED
IN
SO
SERIOUS
MATTER
BUT
YET
IT
EXPRESSETH
WELL
THE
DEFORMITY
THERE
IS
MASTER
OF
SCOFFING
THAT
IN
HIS
CATALOGUE
OF
BOOKS
OF
FEIGNED
LIBRARY
SETS
DOWN
THIS
TITLE
OF
BOOK
THE
MORRIS
DANCE
OF
HERETICS
FOR
INDEED
EVERY
SECT
OF
THEM
HATH
DIVERSE
POSTURE
OR
CRINGE
BY
THEMSELVES
WHICH
CANNOT
BUT
MOVE
DERISION
IN
WORLDLINGS
AND
DEPRAVED
POLITICS
WHO
ARE
APT
TO
CONTEMN
HOLY
THINGS
AS
FOR
THE
FRUIT
TOWARDS
THOSE
THAT
ARE
WITHIN
IT
IS
PEACE
WHICH
CONTAINETH
INFINITE
BLESSINGS
IT
ESTABLISHETH
FAITH
IT
KINDLETH
CHARITY
THE
OUTWARD
PEACE
OF
THE
CHURCH
DISTILLETH
INTO
PEACE
OF
CONSCIENCE
AND
IT
TURNETH
THE
LABORS
OF
WRITING
AND
READING
OF
CONTROVERSIES
INTO
TREATIES
OF
MORTIFICATION
AND
DEVOTION
CONCERNING
THE
BOUNDS
OF
UNITY
THE
TRUE
PLACING
OF
THEM
IMPORTETH
EXCEEDINGLY
THERE
APPEAR
TO
BE
TWO
EXTREMES
FOR
TO
CERTAIN
ZEALANTS
ALL
SPEECH
OF
PACIFICATION
IS
ODIOUS
IS
IT
PEACE
JEHU
WHAT
HAST
THOU
TO
DO
WITH
PEACE
TURN
THEE
BEHIND
ME
PEACE
IS
NOT
THE
MATTER
BUT
FOLLOWING
AND
PARTY
CONTRARIWISE
CERTAIN
LAODICEANS
AND
LUKEWARM
PERSONS
THINK
THEY
MAY
ACCOMMODATE
POINTS
OF
RELIGION
BY
MIDDLE
WAY
AND
TAKING
PART
OF
BOTH
AND
WITTY
RECONCILEMENTS
AS
IF
THEY
WOULD
MAKE
AN
ARBITRAMENT
BETWEEN
GOD
AND
MAN
BOTH
THESE
EXTREMES
ARE
TO
BE
AVOIDED
WHICH
WILL
BE
DONE
IF
THE
LEAGUE
OF
CHRISTIANS
PENNED
BY
OUR
SAVIOR
HIMSELF
WERE
IN
TWO
CROSS
CLAUSES
THEREOF
SOUNDLY
AND
PLAINLY
EXPOUNDED
HE
THAT
IS
NOT
WITH
US
IS
AGAINST
US
AND
AGAIN
HE
THAT
IS
NOT
AGAINST
US
IS
WITH
US
THAT
IS
IF
THE
POINTS
FUNDAMENTAL
AND
OF
SUBSTANCE
IN
RELIGION
WERE
TRULY
DISCERNED
AND
DISTINGUISHED
FROM
POINTS
NOT
MERELY
OF
FAITH
BUT
OF
OPINION
ORDER
OR
GOOD
INTENTION
THIS
IS
THING
MAY
SEEM
TO
MANY
MATTER
TRIVIAL
AND
DONE
ALREADY
BUT
IF
IT
WERE
DONE
LESS
PARTIALLY
IT
WOULD
BE
EMBRACED
MORE
GENERALLY
OF
THIS
MAY
GIVE
ONLY
THIS
ADVICE
ACCORDING
TO
MY
SMALL
MODEL
MEN
OUGHT
TO
TAKE
HEED
OF
RENDING
GOD
CHURCH
BY
TWO
KINDS
OF
CONTROVERSIES
THE
ONE
IS
WHEN
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
POINT
CONTROVERTED
IS
TOO
SMALL
AND
LIGHT
NOT
WORTH
THE
HEAT
AND
STRIFE
ABOUT
IT
KINDLED
ONLY
BY
CONTRADICTION
FOR
AS
IT
IS
NOTED
BY
ONE
OF
THE
FATHERS
CHRIST
COAT
INDEED
HAD
NO
SEAM
BUT
THE
CHURCH
VESTURE
WAS
OF
DIVERS
COLORS
WHEREUPON
HE
SAITH
IN
VESTE
VARIETAS
SIT
SCISSURA
NON
SIT
THEY
BE
TWO
THINGS
UNITY
AND
UNIFORMITY
THE
OTHER
IS
WHEN
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
POINT
CONTROVERTED
IS
GREAT
BUT
IT
IS
DRIVEN
TO
AN
OVER
GREAT
SUBTILTY
AND
OBSCURITY
SO
THAT
IT
BECOMETH
THING
RATHER
INGENIOUS
THAN
SUBSTANTIAL
MAN
THAT
IS
OF
JUDGMENT
AND
UNDERSTANDING
SHALL
SOMETIMES
HEAR
IGNORANT
MEN
DIFFER
AND
KNOW
WELL
WITHIN
HIMSELF
THAT
THOSE
WHICH
SO
DIFFER
MEAN
ONE
THING
AND
YET
THEY
THEMSELVES
WOULD
NEVER
AGREE
AND
IF
IT
COME
SO
TO
PASS
IN
THAT
DISTANCE
OF
JUDGMENT
WHICH
IS
BETWEEN
MAN
AND
MAN
SHALL
WE
NOT
THINK
THAT
GOD
ABOVE
THAT
KNOWS
THE
HEART
DOTH
NOT
DISCERN
THAT
FRAIL
MEN
IN
SOME
OF
THEIR
CONTRADICTIONS
INTEND
THE
SAME
THING
AND
ACCEPTETH
OF
BOTH
THE
NATURE
OF
SUCH
CONTROVERSIES
IS
EXCELLENTLY
EXPRESSED
BY
ST
PAUL
IN
THE
WARNING
AND
PRECEPT
THAT
HE
GIVETH
CONCERNING
THE
SAME
DEVITA
PROFANAS
VOCUM
NOVITATES
ET
OPPOSITIONES
FALSI
NOMINIS
SCIENTIAE
MEN
CREATE
OPPOSITIONS
WHICH
ARE
NOT
AND
PUT
THEM
INTO
NEW
TERMS
SO
FIXED
AS
WHEREAS
THE
MEANING
OUGHT
TO
GOVERN
THE
TERM
THE
TERM
IN
EFFECT
GOVERNETH
THE
MEANING
THERE
BE
ALSO
TWO
FALSE
PEACES
OR
UNITIES
THE
ONE
WHEN
THE
PEACE
IS
GROUNDED
BUT
UPON
AN
IMPLICIT
IGNORANCE
FOR
ALL
COLORS
WILL
AGREE
IN
THE
DARK
THE
OTHER
WHEN
IT
IS
PIECED
UP
UPON
DIRECT
ADMISSION
OF
CONTRARIES
IN
FUNDAMENTAL
POINTS
FOR
TRUTH
AND
FALSEHOOD
IN
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
LIKE
THE
IRON
AND
CLAY
IN
THE
TOES
OF
NEBUCHADNEZZAR
IMAGE
THEY
MAY
CLEAVE
BUT
THEY
WILL
NOT
INCORPORATE
CONCERNING
THE
MEANS
OF
PROCURING
UNITY
MEN
MUST
BEWARE
THAT
IN
THE
PROCURING
OR
REUNITING
OF
RELIGIOUS
UNITY
THEY
DO
NOT
DISSOLVE
AND
DEFACE
THE
LAWS
OF
CHARITY
AND
OF
HUMAN
SOCIETY
THERE
BE
TWO
SWORDS
AMONGST
CHRISTIANS
THE
SPIRITUAL
AND
TEMPORAL
AND
BOTH
HAVE
THEIR
DUE
OFFICE
AND
PLACE
IN
THE
MAINTENANCE
OF
RELIGION
BUT
WE
MAY
NOT
TAKE
UP
THE
THIRD
SWORD
WHICH
IS
MAHOMET
SWORD
OR
LIKE
UNTO
IT
THAT
IS
TO
PROPAGATE
RELIGION
BY
WARS
OR
BY
SANGUINARY
PERSECUTIONS
TO
FORCE
CONSCIENCES
EXCEPT
IT
BE
IN
CASES
OF
OVERT
SCANDAL
BLASPHEMY
OR
INTERMIXTURE
OF
PRACTICE
AGAINST
THE
STATE
MUCH
LESS
TO
NOURISH
SEDITIONS
TO
AUTHORIZE
CONSPIRACIES
AND
REBELLIONS
TO
PUT
THE
SWORD
INTO
THE
PEOPLE
HANDS
AND
THE
LIKE
TENDING
TO
THE
SUBVERSION
OF
ALL
GOVERNMENT
WHICH
IS
THE
ORDINANCE
OF
GOD
FOR
THIS
IS
BUT
TO
DASH
THE
FIRST
TABLE
AGAINST
THE
SECOND
AND
SO
TO
CONSIDER
MEN
AS
CHRISTIANS
AS
WE
FORGET
THAT
THEY
ARE
MEN
LUCRETIUS
THE
POET
WHEN
HE
BEHELD
THE
ACT
OF
AGAMEMNON
THAT
COULD
ENDURE
THE
SACRIFICING
OF
HIS
OWN
DAUGHTER
EXCLAIMED
TANTUM
RELIGIO
POTUIT
SUADERE
MALORUM
WHAT
WOULD
HE
HAVE
SAID
IF
HE
HAD
KNOWN
OF
THE
MASSACRE
IN
FRANCE
OR
THE
POWDER
TREASON
OF
ENGLAND
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SEVEN
TIMES
MORE
EPICURE
AND
ATHEIST
THAN
HE
WAS
FOR
AS
THE
TEMPORAL
SWORD
IS
TO
BE
DRAWN
WITH
GREAT
CIRCUMSPECTION
IN
CASES
OF
RELIGION
SO
IT
IS
THING
MONSTROUS
TO
PUT
IT
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
COMMON
PEOPLE
LET
THAT
BE
LEFT
UNTO
THE
ANABAPTISTS
AND
OTHER
FURIES
IT
WAS
GREAT
BLASPHEMY
WHEN
THE
DEVIL
SAID
WILL
ASCEND
AND
BE
LIKE
THE
HIGHEST
BUT
IT
IS
GREATER
BLASPHEMY
TO
PERSONATE
GOD
AND
BRING
HIM
IN
SAYING
WILL
DESCEND
AND
BE
LIKE
THE
PRINCE
OF
DARKNESS
AND
WHAT
IS
IT
BETTER
TO
MAKE
THE
CAUSE
OF
RELIGION
TO
DESCEND
TO
THE
CRUEL
AND
EXECRABLE
ACTIONS
OF
MURTHERING
PRINCES
BUTCHERY
OF
PEOPLE
AND
SUBVERSION
OF
STATES
AND
GOVERNMENTS
SURELY
THIS
IS
TO
BRING
DOWN
THE
HOLY
GHOST
INSTEAD
OF
THE
LIKENESS
OF
DOVE
IN
THE
SHAPE
OF
VULTURE
OR
RAVEN
AND
SET
OUT
OF
THE
BARK
OF
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
FLAG
OF
BARK
OF
PIRATES
AND
ASSASSINS
THEREFORE
IT
IS
MOST
NECESSARY
THAT
THE
CHURCH
BY
DOCTRINE
AND
DECREE
PRINCES
BY
THEIR
SWORD
AND
ALL
LEARNINGS
BOTH
CHRISTIAN
AND
MORAL
AS
BY
THEIR
MERCURY
ROD
DO
DAMN
AND
SEND
TO
HELL
FOR
EVER
THOSE
FACTS
AND
OPINIONS
TENDING
TO
THE
SUPPORT
OF
THE
SAME
AS
HATH
BEEN
ALREADY
IN
GOOD
PART
DONE
SURELY
IN
COUNSELS
CONCERNING
RELIGION
THAT
COUNSEL
OF
THE
APOSTLE
WOULD
BE
PREFIXED
IRA
HOMINIS
NON
IMPLET
JUSTITIAM
DEI
AND
IT
WAS
NOTABLE
OBSERVATION
OF
WISE
FATHER
AND
NO
LESS
INGENUOUSLY
CONFESSED
THAT
THOSE
WHICH
HELD
AND
PERSUADED
PRESSURE
OF
CONSCIENCES
WERE
COMMONLY
INTERESTED
THEREIN
THEMSELVES
FOR
THEIR
OWN
ENDS
OF
REVENGE
REVENGE
IS
KIND
OF
WILD
JUSTICE
WHICH
THE
MORE
MAN
NATURE
RUNS
TO
THE
MORE
OUGHT
LAW
TO
WEED
IT
OUT
FOR
AS
FOR
THE
FIRST
WRONG
IT
DOTH
BUT
OFFEND
THE
LAW
BUT
THE
REVENGE
OF
THAT
WRONG
PUTTETH
THE
LAW
OUT
OF
OFFICE
CERTAINLY
IN
TAKING
REVENGE
MAN
IS
BUT
EVEN
WITH
HIS
ENEMY
BUT
IN
PASSING
IT
OVER
HE
IS
SUPERIOR
FOR
IT
IS
PRINCE
PART
TO
PARDON
AND
SOLOMON
AM
SURE
SAITH
IT
IS
THE
GLORY
OF
MAN
TO
PASS
BY
AN
OFFENCE
THAT
WHICH
IS
PAST
IS
GONE
AND
IRREVOCABLE
AND
WISE
MEN
HAVE
ENOUGH
TO
DO
WITH
THINGS
PRESENT
AND
TO
COME
THEREFORE
THEY
DO
BUT
TRIFLE
WITH
THEMSELVES
THAT
LABOR
IN
PAST
MATTERS
THERE
IS
NO
MAN
DOTH
WRONG
FOR
THE
WRONG
SAKE
BUT
THEREBY
TO
PURCHASE
HIMSELF
PROFIT
OR
PLEASURE
OR
HONOR
OR
THE
LIKE
THEREFORE
WHY
SHOULD
BE
ANGRY
WITH
MAN
FOR
LOVING
HIMSELF
BETTER
THAN
ME
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
SHOULD
DO
WRONG
MERELY
OUT
OF
ILL
NATURE
WHY
YET
IT
IS
BUT
LIKE
THE
THORN
OR
BRIAR
WHICH
PRICK
AND
SCRATCH
BECAUSE
THEY
CAN
DO
NO
OTHER
THE
MOST
TOLERABLE
SORT
OF
REVENGE
IS
FOR
THOSE
WRONGS
WHICH
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
TO
REMEDY
BUT
THEN
LET
MAN
TAKE
HEED
THE
REVENGE
BE
SUCH
AS
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
TO
PUNISH
ELSE
MAN
ENEMY
IS
STILL
BEFORE
HAND
AND
IT
IS
TWO
FOR
ONE
SOME
WHEN
THEY
TAKE
REVENGE
ARE
DESIROUS
THE
PARTY
SHOULD
KNOW
WHENCE
IT
COMETH
THIS
IS
THE
MORE
GENEROUS
FOR
THE
DELIGHT
SEEMETH
TO
BE
NOT
SO
MUCH
IN
DOING
THE
HURT
AS
IN
MAKING
THE
PARTY
REPENT
BUT
BASE
AND
CRAFTY
COWARDS
ARE
LIKE
THE
ARROW
THAT
FLIETH
IN
THE
DARK
COSMUS
DUKE
OF
FLORENCE
HAD
DESPERATE
SAYING
AGAINST
PERFIDIOUS
OR
NEGLECTING
FRIENDS
AS
IF
THOSE
WRONGS
WERE
UNPARDONABLE
YOU
SHALL
READ
SAITH
HE
THAT
WE
ARE
COMMANDED
TO
FORGIVE
OUR
ENEMIES
BUT
YOU
NEVER
READ
THAT
WE
ARE
COMMANDED
TO
FORGIVE
OUR
FRIENDS
BUT
YET
THE
SPIRIT
OF
JOB
WAS
IN
BETTER
TUNE
SHALL
WE
SAITH
HE
TAKE
GOOD
AT
GOD
HANDS
AND
NOT
BE
CONTENT
TO
TAKE
EVIL
ALSO
AND
SO
OF
FRIENDS
IN
PROPORTION
THIS
IS
CERTAIN
THAT
MAN
THAT
STUDIETH
REVENGE
KEEPS
HIS
OWN
WOUNDS
GREEN
WHICH
OTHERWISE
WOULD
HEAL
AND
DO
WELL
PUBLIC
REVENGES
ARE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
FORTUNATE
AS
THAT
FOR
THE
DEATH
OF
CAESAR
FOR
THE
DEATH
OF
PERTINAX
FOR
THE
DEATH
OF
HENRY
THE
THIRD
OF
FRANCE
AND
MANY
MORE
BUT
IN
PRIVATE
REVENGES
IT
IS
NOT
SO
NAY
RATHER
VINDICTIVE
PERSONS
LIVE
THE
LIFE
OF
WITCHES
WHO
AS
THEY
ARE
MISCHIEVOUS
SO
END
THEY
INFORTUNATE
OF
ADVERSITY
IT
WAS
AN
HIGH
SPEECH
OF
SENECA
AFTER
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
STOICS
THAT
THE
GOOD
THINGS
WHICH
BELONG
TO
PROSPERITY
ARE
TO
BE
WISHED
BUT
THE
GOOD
THINGS
THAT
BELONG
TO
ADVERSITY
ARE
TO
BE
ADMIRED
BONA
RERUM
SECUNDARUM
OPTABILIA
ADVERSARUM
MIRABILIA
CERTAINLY
IF
MIRACLES
BE
THE
COMMAND
OVER
NATURE
THEY
APPEAR
MOST
IN
ADVERSITY
IT
IS
YET
HIGHER
SPEECH
OF
HIS
THAN
THE
OTHER
MUCH
TOO
HIGH
FOR
HEATHEN
IT
IS
TRUE
GREATNESS
TO
HAVE
IN
ONE
THE
FRAILTY
OF
MAN
AND
THE
SECURITY
OF
GOD
VERE
MAGNUM
HABERE
FRAGILITATEM
HOMINIS
SECURITATEM
DEI
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
BETTER
IN
POESY
WHERE
TRANSCENDENCES
ARE
MORE
ALLOWED
AND
THE
POETS
INDEED
HAVE
BEEN
BUSY
WITH
IT
FOR
IT
IS
IN
EFFECT
THE
THING
WHICH
FIGURED
IN
THAT
STRANGE
FICTION
OF
THE
ANCIENT
POETS
WHICH
SEEMETH
NOT
TO
BE
WITHOUT
MYSTERY
NAY
AND
TO
HAVE
SOME
APPROACH
TO
THE
STATE
OF
CHRISTIAN
THAT
HERCULES
WHEN
HE
WENT
TO
UNBIND
PROMETHEUS
BY
WHOM
HUMAN
NATURE
IS
REPRESENTED
SAILED
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
GREAT
OCEAN
IN
AN
EARTHEN
POT
OR
PITCHER
LIVELY
DESCRIBING
CHRISTIAN
RESOLUTION
THAT
SAILETH
IN
THE
FRAIL
BARK
OF
THE
FLESH
THROUGH
THE
WAVES
OF
THE
WORLD
BUT
TO
SPEAK
IN
MEAN
THE
VIRTUE
OF
PROSPERITY
IS
TEMPERANCE
THE
VIRTUE
OF
ADVERSITY
IS
FORTITUDE
WHICH
IN
MORALS
IS
THE
MORE
HEROICAL
VIRTUE
PROSPERITY
IS
THE
BLESSING
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
ADVERSITY
IS
THE
BLESSING
OF
THE
NEW
WHICH
CARRIETH
THE
GREATER
BENEDICTION
AND
THE
CLEARER
REVELATION
OF
GOD
FAVOR
YET
EVEN
IN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
IF
YOU
LISTEN
TO
DAVID
HARP
YOU
SHALL
HEAR
AS
MANY
HEARSE
LIKE
AIRS
AS
CAROLS
AND
THE
PENCIL
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
HATH
LABORED
MORE
IN
DESCRIBING
THE
AFFLICTIONS
OF
JOB
THAN
THE
FELICITIES
OF
SOLOMON
PROSPERITY
IS
NOT
WITHOUT
MANY
FEARS
AND
DISTASTES
AND
ADVERSITY
IS
NOT
WITHOUT
COMFORTS
AND
HOPES
WE
SEE
IN
NEEDLE
WORKS
AND
EMBROIDERIES
IT
IS
MORE
PLEASING
TO
HAVE
LIVELY
WORK
UPON
SAD
AND
SOLEMN
GROUND
THAN
TO
HAVE
DARK
AND
MELANCHOLY
WORK
UPON
LIGHTSOME
GROUND
JUDGE
THEREFORE
OF
THE
PLEASURE
OF
THE
HEART
BY
THE
PLEASURE
OF
THE
EYE
CERTAINLY
VIRTUE
IS
LIKE
PRECIOUS
ODORS
MOST
FRAGRANT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
INCENSED
OR
CRUSHED
FOR
PROSPERITY
DOTH
BEST
DISCOVER
VICE
BUT
ADVERSITY
DOTH
BEST
DISCOVER
VIRTUE
OF
SIMULATION
AND
DISSIMULATION
DISSIMULATION
IS
BUT
FAINT
KIND
OF
POLICY
OR
WISDOM
FOR
IT
ASKETH
STRONG
WIT
AND
STRONG
HEART
TO
KNOW
WHEN
TO
TELL
TRUTH
AND
TO
DO
IT
THEREFORE
IT
IS
THE
WEAKER
SORT
OF
POLITICS
THAT
ARE
THE
GREAT
DISSEMBLERS
TACITUS
SAITH
LIVIA
SORTED
WELL
WITH
THE
ARTS
OF
HER
HUSBAND
AND
DISSIMULATION
OF
HER
SON
ATTRIBUTING
ARTS
OR
POLICY
TO
AUGUSTUS
AND
DISSIMULATION
TO
TIBERIUS
AND
AGAIN
WHEN
MUCIANUS
ENCOURAGETH
VESPASIAN
TO
TAKE
ARMS
AGAINST
VITELLIUS
HE
SAITH
WE
RISE
NOT
AGAINST
THE
PIERCING
JUDGMENT
OF
AUGUSTUS
NOR
THE
EXTREME
CAUTION
OR
CLOSENESS
OF
TIBERIUS
THESE
PROPERTIES
OF
ARTS
OR
POLICY
AND
DISSIMULATION
OR
CLOSENESS
ARE
INDEED
HABITS
AND
FACULTIES
SEVERAL
AND
TO
BE
DISTINGUISHED
FOR
IF
MAN
HAVE
THAT
PENETRATION
OF
JUDGMENT
AS
HE
CAN
DISCERN
WHAT
THINGS
ARE
TO
BE
LAID
OPEN
AND
WHAT
TO
BE
SECRETED
AND
WHAT
TO
BE
SHOWED
AT
HALF
LIGHTS
AND
TO
WHOM
AND
WHEN
WHICH
INDEED
ARE
ARTS
OF
STATE
AND
ARTS
OF
LIFE
AS
TACITUS
WELL
CALLETH
THEM
TO
HIM
HABIT
OF
DISSIMULATION
IS
HINDERANCE
AND
POORNESS
BUT
IF
MAN
CANNOT
OBTAIN
TO
THAT
JUDGMENT
THEN
IT
IS
LEFT
TO
HIM
GENERALLY
TO
BE
CLOSE
AND
DISSEMBLER
FOR
WHERE
MAN
CANNOT
CHOOSE
OR
VARY
IN
PARTICULARS
THERE
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
TAKE
THE
SAFEST
AND
WARIEST
WAY
IN
GENERAL
LIKE
THE
GOING
SOFTLY
BY
ONE
THAT
CANNOT
WELL
SEE
CERTAINLY
THE
ABLEST
MEN
THAT
EVER
WERE
HAVE
HAD
ALL
AN
OPENNESS
AND
FRANKNESS
OF
DEALING
AND
NAME
OF
CERTAINTY
AND
VERACITY
BUT
THEN
THEY
WERE
LIKE
HORSES
WELL
MANAGED
FOR
THEY
COULD
TELL
PASSING
WELL
WHEN
TO
STOP
OR
TURN
AND
AT
SUCH
TIMES
WHEN
THEY
THOUGHT
THE
CASE
INDEED
REQUIRED
DISSIMULATION
IF
THEN
THEY
USED
IT
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
THE
FORMER
OPINION
SPREAD
ABROAD
OF
THEIR
GOOD
FAITH
AND
CLEARNESS
OF
DEALING
MADE
THEM
ALMOST
INVISIBLE
THERE
BE
THREE
DEGREES
OF
THIS
HIDING
AND
VEILING
OF
MAN
SELF
THE
FIRST
CLOSENESS
RESERVATION
AND
SECRECY
WHEN
MAN
LEAVETH
HIMSELF
WITHOUT
OBSERVATION
OR
WITHOUT
HOLD
TO
BE
TAKEN
WHAT
HE
IS
THE
SECOND
DISSIMULATION
IN
THE
NEGATIVE
WHEN
MAN
LETS
FALL
SIGNS
AND
ARGUMENTS
THAT
HE
IS
NOT
THAT
HE
IS
AND
THE
THIRD
SIMULATION
IN
THE
AFFIRMATIVE
WHEN
MAN
INDUSTRIOUSLY
AND
EXPRESSLY
FEIGNS
AND
PRETENDS
TO
BE
THAT
HE
IS
NOT
FOR
THE
FIRST
OF
THESE
SECRECY
IT
IS
INDEED
THE
VIRTUE
OF
CONFESSOR
AND
ASSUREDLY
THE
SECRET
MAN
HEARETH
MANY
CONFESSIONS
FOR
WHO
WILL
OPEN
HIMSELF
TO
BLAB
OR
BABBLER
BUT
IF
MAN
BE
THOUGHT
SECRET
IT
INVITETH
DISCOVERY
AS
THE
MORE
CLOSE
AIR
SUCKETH
IN
THE
MORE
OPEN
AND
AS
IN
CONFESSION
THE
REVEALING
IS
NOT
FOR
WORLDLY
USE
BUT
FOR
THE
EASE
OF
MAN
HEART
SO
SECRET
MEN
COME
TO
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
MANY
THINGS
IN
THAT
KIND
WHILE
MEN
RATHER
DISCHARGE
THEIR
MINDS
THAN
IMPART
THEIR
MINDS
IN
FEW
WORDS
MYSTERIES
ARE
DUE
TO
SECRECY
BESIDES
TO
SAY
TRUTH
NAKEDNESS
IS
UNCOMELY
AS
WELL
IN
MIND
AS
BODY
AND
IT
ADDETH
NO
SMALL
REVERENCE
TO
MEN
MANNERS
AND
ACTIONS
IF
THEY
BE
NOT
ALTOGETHER
OPEN
AS
FOR
TALKERS
AND
FUTILE
PERSONS
THEY
ARE
COMMONLY
VAIN
AND
CREDULOUS
WITHAL
FOR
HE
THAT
TALKETH
WHAT
HE
KNOWETH
WILL
ALSO
TALK
WHAT
HE
KNOWETH
NOT
THEREFORE
SET
IT
DOWN
THAT
AN
HABIT
OF
SECRECY
IS
BOTH
POLITIC
AND
MORAL
AND
IN
THIS
PART
IT
IS
GOOD
THAT
MAN
FACE
GIVE
HIS
TONGUE
LEAVE
TO
SPEAK
FOR
THE
DISCOVERY
OF
MAN
SELF
BY
THE
TRACTS
OF
HIS
COUNTENANCE
IS
GREAT
WEAKNESS
AND
BETRAYING
BY
HOW
MUCH
IT
IS
MANY
TIMES
MORE
MARKED
AND
BELIEVED
THAN
MAN
WORDS
FOR
THE
SECOND
WHICH
IS
DISSIMULATION
IT
FOLLOWETH
MANY
TIMES
UPON
SECRECY
BY
NECESSITY
SO
THAT
HE
THAT
WILL
BE
SECRET
MUST
BE
DISSEMBLER
IN
SOME
DEGREE
FOR
MEN
ARE
TOO
CUNNING
TO
SUFFER
MAN
TO
KEEP
AN
INDIFFERENT
CARRIAGE
BETWEEN
BOTH
AND
TO
BE
SECRET
WITHOUT
SWAYING
THE
BALANCE
ON
EITHER
SIDE
THEY
WILL
SO
BESET
MAN
WITH
QUESTIONS
AND
DRAW
HIM
ON
AND
PICK
IT
OUT
OF
HIM
THAT
WITHOUT
AN
ABSURD
SILENCE
HE
MUST
SHOW
AN
INCLINATION
ONE
WAY
OR
IF
HE
DO
NOT
THEY
WILL
GATHER
AS
MUCH
BY
HIS
SILENCE
AS
BY
HIS
SPEECH
AS
FOR
EQUIVOCATIONS
OR
ORACULOUS
SPEECHES
THEY
CANNOT
HOLD
OUT
LONG
SO
THAT
NO
MAN
CAN
BE
SECRET
EXCEPT
HE
GIVE
HIMSELF
LITTLE
SCOPE
OF
DISSIMULATION
WHICH
IS
AS
IT
WERE
BUT
THE
SKIRTS
OR
TRAIN
OF
SECRECY
BUT
FOR
THE
THIRD
DEGREE
WHICH
IS
SIMULATION
AND
FALSE
PROFESSION
THAT
HOLD
MORE
CULPABLE
AND
LESS
POLITIC
EXCEPT
IT
BE
IN
GREAT
AND
RARE
MATTERS
AND
THEREFORE
GENERAL
CUSTOM
OF
SIMULATION
WHICH
IS
THIS
LAST
DEGREE
IS
VICE
USING
EITHER
OF
NATURAL
FALSENESS
OR
FEARFULNESS
OR
OF
MIND
THAT
HATH
SOME
MAIN
FAULTS
WHICH
BECAUSE
MAN
MUST
NEEDS
DISGUISE
IT
MAKETH
HIM
PRACTISE
SIMULATION
IN
OTHER
THINGS
LEST
HIS
HAND
SHOULD
BE
OUT
OF
USE
THE
GREAT
ADVANTAGES
OF
SIMULATION
AND
DISSIMULATION
ARE
THREE
FIRST
TO
LAY
ASLEEP
OPPOSITION
AND
TO
SURPRISE
FOR
WHERE
MAN
INTENTIONS
ARE
PUBLISHED
IT
IS
AN
ALARUM
TO
CALL
UP
ALL
THAT
ARE
AGAINST
THEM
THE
SECOND
IS
TO
RESERVE
TO
MAN
SELF
FAIR
RETREAT
FOR
IF
MAN
ENGAGE
HIMSELF
BY
MANIFEST
DECLARATION
HE
MUST
GO
THROUGH
OR
TAKE
FALL
THE
THIRD
IS
THE
BETTER
TO
DISCOVER
THE
MIND
OF
ANOTHER
FOR
TO
HIM
THAT
OPENS
HIMSELF
MEN
WILL
HARDLY
SHOW
THEMSELVES
ADVERSE
BUT
WILL
FAIR
LET
HIM
GO
ON
AND
TURN
THEIR
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
TO
FREEDOM
OF
THOUGHT
AND
THEREFORE
IT
IS
GOOD
SHREWD
PROVERB
OF
THE
SPANIARD
TELL
LIE
AND
FIND
TROTH
AS
IF
THERE
WERE
NO
WAY
OF
DISCOVERY
BUT
BY
SIMULATION
THERE
BE
ALSO
THREE
DISADVANTAGES
TO
SET
IT
EVEN
THE
FIRST
THAT
SIMULATION
AND
DISSIMULATION
COMMONLY
CARRY
WITH
THEM
SHOW
OF
FEARFULNESS
WHICH
IN
ANY
BUSINESS
DOTH
SPOIL
THE
FEATHERS
OF
ROUND
FLYING
UP
TO
THE
MARK
THE
SECOND
THAT
IT
PUZZLETH
AND
PERPLEXETH
THE
CONCEITS
OF
MANY
THAT
PERHAPS
WOULD
OTHERWISE
CO
OPERATE
WITH
HIM
AND
MAKES
MAN
WALK
ALMOST
ALONE
TO
HIS
OWN
ENDS
THE
THIRD
AND
GREATEST
IS
THAT
IT
DEPRIVETH
MAN
OF
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
PRINCIPAL
INSTRUMENTS
FOR
ACTION
WHICH
IS
TRUST
AND
BELIEF
THE
BEST
COMPOSITION
AND
TEMPERATURE
IS
TO
HAVE
OPENNESS
IN
FAME
AND
OPINION
SECRECY
IN
HABIT
DISSIMULATION
IN
SEASONABLE
USE
AND
POWER
TO
FEIGN
IF
THERE
BE
NO
REMEDY
OF
PARENTS
AND
CHILDREN
THE
JOYS
OF
PARENTS
ARE
SECRET
AND
SO
ARE
THEIR
GRIEFS
AND
FEARS
THEY
CANNOT
UTTER
THE
ONE
NOR
THEY
WILL
NOT
UTTER
THE
OTHER
CHILDREN
SWEETEN
LABORS
BUT
THEY
MAKE
MISFORTUNES
MORE
BITTER
THEY
INCREASE
THE
CARES
OF
LIFE
BUT
THEY
MITIGATE
THE
REMEMBRANCE
OF
DEATH
THE
PERPETUITY
BY
GENERATION
IS
COMMON
TO
BEASTS
BUT
MEMORY
MERIT
AND
NOBLE
WORKS
ARE
PROPER
TO
MEN
AND
SURELY
MAN
SHALL
SEE
THE
NOBLEST
WORKS
AND
FOUNDATIONS
HAVE
PROCEEDED
FROM
CHILDLESS
MEN
WHICH
HAVE
SOUGHT
TO
EXPRESS
THE
IMAGES
OF
THEIR
MINDS
WHERE
THOSE
OF
THEIR
BODIES
HAVE
FAILED
SO
THE
CARE
OF
POSTERITY
IS
MOST
IN
THEM
THAT
HAVE
NO
POSTERITY
THEY
THAT
ARE
THE
FIRST
RAISERS
OF
THEIR
HOUSES
ARE
MOST
INDULGENT
TOWARDS
THEIR
CHILDREN
BEHOLDING
THEM
AS
THE
CONTINUANCE
NOT
ONLY
OF
THEIR
KIND
BUT
OF
THEIR
WORK
AND
SO
BOTH
CHILDREN
AND
CREATURES
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
AFFECTION
OF
PARENTS
TOWARDS
THEIR
SEVERAL
CHILDREN
IS
MANY
TIMES
UNEQUAL
AND
SOMETIMES
UNWORTHY
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
MOTHERS
AS
SOLOMON
SAITH
WISE
SON
REJOICETH
THE
FATHER
BUT
AN
UNGRACIOUS
SON
SHAMES
THE
MOTHER
MAN
SHALL
SEE
WHERE
THERE
IS
HOUSE
FULL
OF
CHILDREN
ONE
OR
TWO
OF
THE
ELDEST
RESPECTED
AND
THE
YOUNGEST
MADE
WANTONS
BUT
IN
THE
MIDST
SOME
THAT
ARE
AS
IT
WERE
FORGOTTEN
WHO
MANY
TIMES
NEVERTHELESS
PROVE
THE
BEST
THE
ILLIBERALITY
OF
PARENTS
IN
ALLOWANCE
TOWARDS
THEIR
CHILDREN
IS
AN
HARMFUL
ERROR
MAKES
THEM
BASE
ACQUAINTS
THEM
WITH
SHIFTS
MAKES
THEM
SORT
WITH
MEAN
COMPANY
AND
MAKES
THEM
SURFEIT
MORE
WHEN
THEY
COME
TO
PLENTY
AND
THEREFORE
THE
PROOF
IS
BEST
WHEN
MEN
KEEP
THEIR
AUTHORITY
TOWARDS
THE
CHILDREN
BUT
NOT
THEIR
PURSE
MEN
HAVE
FOOLISH
MANNER
BOTH
PARENTS
AND
SCHOOLMASTERS
AND
SERVANTS
IN
CREATING
AND
BREEDING
AN
EMULATION
BETWEEN
BROTHERS
DURING
CHILDHOOD
WHICH
MANY
TIMES
SORTETH
TO
DISCORD
WHEN
THEY
ARE
MEN
AND
DISTURBETH
FAMILIES
THE
ITALIANS
MAKE
LITTLE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CHILDREN
AND
NEPHEWS
OR
NEAR
KINSFOLKS
BUT
SO
THEY
BE
OF
THE
LUMP
THEY
CARE
NOT
THOUGH
THEY
PASS
NOT
THROUGH
THEIR
OWN
BODY
AND
TO
SAY
TRUTH
IN
NATURE
IT
IS
MUCH
LIKE
MATTER
INSOMUCH
THAT
WE
SEE
NEPHEW
SOMETIMES
RESEMBLETH
AN
UNCLE
OR
KINSMAN
MORE
THAN
HIS
OWN
PARENT
AS
THE
BLOOD
HAPPENS
LET
PARENTS
CHOOSE
BETIMES
THE
VOCATIONS
AND
COURSES
THEY
MEAN
THEIR
CHILDREN
SHOULD
TAKE
FOR
THEN
THEY
ARE
MOST
FLEXIBLE
AND
LET
THEM
NOT
TOO
MUCH
APPLY
THEMSELVES
TO
THE
DISPOSITION
OF
THEIR
CHILDREN
AS
THINKING
THEY
WILL
TAKE
BEST
TO
THAT
WHICH
THEY
HAVE
MOST
MIND
TO
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
IF
THE
AFFECTION
OR
APTNESS
OF
THE
CHILDREN
BE
EXTRAORDINARY
THEN
IT
IS
GOOD
NOT
TO
CROSS
IT
BUT
GENERALLY
THE
PRECEPT
IS
GOOD
OPTIMUM
ELIGE
SUAVE
ET
FACILE
ILLUD
FACIET
CONSUETUDO
YOUNGER
BROTHERS
ARE
COMMONLY
FORTUNATE
BUT
SELDOM
OR
NEVER
WHERE
THE
ELDER
ARE
DISINHERITED
OF
MARRIAGE
AND
SINGLE
LIFE
HE
THAT
HATH
WIFE
AND
CHILDREN
HATH
GIVEN
HOSTAGES
TO
FORTUNE
FOR
THEY
ARE
IMPEDIMENTS
TO
GREAT
ENTERPRISES
EITHER
OF
VIRTUE
OR
MISCHIEF
CERTAINLY
THE
BEST
WORKS
AND
OF
GREATEST
MERIT
FOR
THE
PUBLIC
HAVE
PROCEEDED
FROM
THE
UNMARRIED
OR
CHILDLESS
MEN
WHICH
BOTH
IN
AFFECTION
AND
MEANS
HAVE
MARRIED
AND
ENDOWED
THE
PUBLIC
YET
IT
WERE
GREAT
REASON
THAT
THOSE
THAT
HAVE
CHILDREN
SHOULD
HAVE
GREATEST
CARE
OF
FUTURE
TIMES
UNTO
WHICH
THEY
KNOW
THEY
MUST
TRANSMIT
THEIR
DEAREST
PLEDGES
SOME
THERE
ARE
WHO
THOUGH
THEY
LEAD
SINGLE
LIFE
YET
THEIR
THOUGHTS
DO
END
WITH
THEMSELVES
AND
ACCOUNT
FUTURE
TIMES
IMPERTINENCES
NAY
THERE
ARE
SOME
OTHER
THAT
ACCOUNT
WIFE
AND
CHILDREN
BUT
AS
BILLS
OF
CHARGES
NAY
MORE
THERE
ARE
SOME
FOOLISH
RICH
COVETOUS
MEN
THAT
TAKE
PRIDE
IN
HAVING
NO
CHILDREN
BECAUSE
THEY
MAY
BE
THOUGHT
SO
MUCH
THE
RICHER
FOR
PERHAPS
THEY
HAVE
HEARD
SOME
TALK
SUCH
AN
ONE
IS
GREAT
RICH
MAN
AND
ANOTHER
EXCEPT
TO
IT
YEA
BUT
HE
HATH
GREAT
CHARGE
OF
CHILDREN
AS
IF
IT
WERE
AN
ABATEMENT
TO
HIS
RICHES
BUT
THE
MOST
ORDINARY
CAUSE
OF
SINGLE
LIFE
IS
LIBERTY
ESPECIALLY
IN
CERTAIN
SELF
PLEASING
AND
HUMOROUS
MINDS
WHICH
ARE
SO
SENSIBLE
OF
EVERY
RESTRAINT
AS
THEY
WILL
GO
NEAR
TO
THINK
THEIR
GIRDLES
AND
GARTERS
TO
BE
BONDS
AND
SHACKLES
UNMARRIED
MEN
ARE
BEST
FRIENDS
BEST
MASTERS
BEST
SERVANTS
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
BEST
SUBJECTS
FOR
THEY
ARE
LIGHT
TO
RUN
AWAY
AND
ALMOST
ALL
FUGITIVES
ARE
OF
THAT
CONDITION
SINGLE
LIFE
DOTH
WELL
WITH
CHURCHMEN
FOR
CHARITY
WILL
HARDLY
WATER
THE
GROUND
WHERE
IT
MUST
FIRST
FILL
POOL
IT
IS
INDIFFERENT
FOR
JUDGES
AND
MAGISTRATES
FOR
IF
THEY
BE
FACILE
AND
CORRUPT
YOU
SHALL
HAVE
SERVANT
FIVE
TIMES
WORSE
THAN
WIFE
FOR
SOLDIERS
FIND
THE
GENERALS
COMMONLY
IN
THEIR
HORTATIVES
PUT
MEN
IN
MIND
OF
THEIR
WIVES
AND
CHILDREN
AND
THINK
THE
DESPISING
OF
MARRIAGE
AMONGST
THE
TURKS
MAKETH
THE
VULGAR
SOLDIER
MORE
BASE
CERTAINLY
WIFE
AND
CHILDREN
ARE
KIND
OF
DISCIPLINE
OF
HUMANITY
AND
SINGLE
MEN
THOUGH
THEY
MAY
BE
MANY
TIMES
MORE
CHARITABLE
BECAUSE
THEIR
MEANS
ARE
LESS
EXHAUST
YET
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
THEY
ARE
MORE
CRUEL
AND
HARDHEARTED
GOOD
TO
MAKE
SEVERE
INQUISITORS
BECAUSE
THEIR
TENDERNESS
IS
NOT
SO
OFT
CALLED
UPON
GRAVE
NATURES
LED
BY
CUSTOM
AND
THEREFORE
CONSTANT
ARE
COMMONLY
LOVING
HUSBANDS
AS
WAS
SAID
OF
ULYSSES
VETULAM
SUAM
PRAETULIT
IMMORTALITATI
CHASTE
WOMEN
ARE
OFTEN
PROUD
AND
FROWARD
AS
PRESUMING
UPON
THE
MERIT
OF
THEIR
CHASTITY
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
BONDS
BOTH
OF
CHASTITY
AND
OBEDIENCE
IN
THE
WIFE
IF
SHE
THINK
HER
HUSBAND
WISE
WHICH
SHE
WILL
NEVER
DO
IF
SHE
FIND
HIM
JEALOUS
WIVES
ARE
YOUNG
MEN
MISTRESSES
COMPANIONS
FOR
MIDDLE
AGE
AND
OLD
MEN
NURSES
SO
AS
MAN
MAY
HAVE
QUARREL
TO
MARRY
WHEN
HE
WILL
BUT
YET
HE
WAS
REPUTED
ONE
OF
THE
WISE
MEN
THAT
MADE
ANSWER
TO
THE
QUESTION
WHEN
MAN
SHOULD
MARRY
YOUNG
MAN
NOT
YET
AN
ELDER
MAN
NOT
AT
ALL
IT
IS
OFTEN
SEEN
THAT
BAD
HUSBANDS
HAVE
VERY
GOOD
WIVES
WHETHER
IT
BE
THAT
IT
RAISETH
THE
PRICE
OF
THEIR
HUSBAND
KINDNESS
WHEN
IT
COMES
OR
THAT
THE
WIVES
TAKE
PRIDE
IN
THEIR
PATIENCE
BUT
THIS
NEVER
FAILS
IF
THE
BAD
HUSBANDS
WERE
OF
THEIR
OWN
CHOOSING
AGAINST
THEIR
FRIENDS
CONSENT
FOR
THEN
THEY
WILL
BE
SURE
TO
MAKE
GOOD
THEIR
OWN
FOLLY
OF
ENVY
THERE
BE
NONE
OF
THE
AFFECTIONS
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
NOTED
TO
FASCINATE
OR
BEWITCH
BUT
LOVE
AND
ENVY
THEY
BOTH
HAVE
VEHEMENT
WISHES
THEY
FRAME
THEMSELVES
READILY
INTO
IMAGINATIONS
AND
SUGGESTIONS
AND
THEY
COME
EASILY
INTO
THE
EYE
ESPECIALLY
UPON
THE
PRESENT
OF
THE
OBJECTS
WHICH
ARE
THE
POINTS
THAT
CONDUCE
TO
FASCINATION
IF
ANY
SUCH
THING
THERE
BE
WE
SEE
LIKEWISE
THE
SCRIPTURE
CALLETH
ENVY
AN
EVIL
EYE
AND
THE
ASTROLOGERS
CALL
THE
EVIL
INFLUENCES
OF
THE
STARS
EVIL
ASPECTS
SO
THAT
STILL
THERE
SEEMETH
TO
BE
ACKNOWLEDGED
IN
THE
ACT
OF
ENVY
AN
EJACULATION
OR
IRRADIATION
OF
THE
EYE
NAY
SOME
HAVE
BEEN
SO
CURIOUS
AS
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
TIMES
WHEN
THE
STROKE
OR
PERCUSSION
OF
AN
ENVIOUS
EYE
DOTH
MOST
HURT
ARE
WHEN
THE
PARTY
ENVIED
IS
BEHELD
IN
GLORY
OR
TRIUMPH
FOR
THAT
SETS
AN
EDGE
UPON
ENVY
AND
BESIDES
AT
SUCH
TIMES
THE
SPIRITS
OF
THE
PERSON
ENVIED
DO
COME
FORTH
MOST
INTO
THE
OUTWARD
PARTS
AND
SO
MEET
THE
BLOW
BUT
LEAVING
THESE
CURIOSITIES
THOUGH
NOT
UNWORTHY
TO
BE
THOUGHT
ON
IN
FIT
PLACE
WE
WILL
HANDLE
WHAT
PERSONS
ARE
APT
TO
ENVY
OTHERS
WHAT
PERSONS
ARE
MOST
SUBJECT
TO
BE
ENVIED
THEMSELVES
AND
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
PUBLIC
AND
PRIVATE
ENVY
MAN
THAT
HATH
NO
VIRTUE
IN
HIMSELF
EVER
ENVIETH
VIRTUE
IN
OTHERS
FOR
MEN
MINDS
WILL
EITHER
FEED
UPON
THEIR
OWN
GOOD
OR
UPON
OTHERS
EVIL
AND
WHO
WANTETH
THE
ONE
WILL
PREY
UPON
THE
OTHER
AND
WHOSO
IS
OUT
OF
HOPE
TO
ATTAIN
TO
ANOTHER
VIRTUE
WILL
SEEK
TO
COME
AT
EVEN
HAND
BY
DEPRESSING
ANOTHER
FORTUNE
MAN
THAT
IS
BUSY
AND
INQUISITIVE
IS
COMMONLY
ENVIOUS
FOR
TO
KNOW
MUCH
OF
OTHER
MEN
MATTERS
CANNOT
BE
BECAUSE
ALL
THAT
ADO
MAY
CONCERN
HIS
OWN
ESTATE
THEREFORE
IT
MUST
NEEDS
BE
THAT
HE
TAKETH
KIND
OF
PLAY
PLEASURE
IN
LOOKING
UPON
THE
FORTUNES
OF
OTHERS
NEITHER
CAN
HE
THAT
MINDETH
BUT
HIS
OWN
BUSINESS
FIND
MUCH
MATTER
FOR
ENVY
FOR
ENVY
IS
GADDING
PASSION
AND
WALKETH
THE
STREETS
AND
DOTH
NOT
KEEP
HOME
NON
EST
CURIOSUS
QUIN
IDEM
SIT
MALEVOLUS
MEN
OF
NOBLE
BIRTH
ARE
NOTED
TO
BE
ENVIOUS
TOWARDS
NEW
MEN
WHEN
THEY
RISE
FOR
THE
DISTANCE
IS
ALTERED
AND
IT
IS
LIKE
DECEIT
OF
THE
EYE
THAT
WHEN
OTHERS
COME
ON
THEY
THINK
THEMSELVES
GO
BACK
DEFORMED
PERSONS
AND
EUNUCHS
AND
OLD
MEN
AND
BASTARDS
ARE
ENVIOUS
FOR
HE
THAT
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
MEND
HIS
OWN
CASE
WILL
DO
WHAT
HE
CAN
TO
IMPAIR
ANOTHER
EXCEPT
THESE
DEFECTS
LIGHT
UPON
VERY
BRAVE
AND
HEROICAL
NATURE
WHICH
THINKETH
TO
MAKE
HIS
NATURAL
WANTS
PART
OF
HIS
HONOR
IN
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
SAID
THAT
AN
EUNUCH
OR
LAME
MAN
DID
SUCH
GREAT
MATTERS
AFFECTING
THE
HONOR
OF
MIRACLE
AS
IT
WAS
IN
NARSES
THE
EUNUCH
AND
AGESILAUS
AND
TAMBERLANES
THAT
WERE
LAME
MEN
THE
SAME
IS
THE
CASE
OF
MEN
THAT
RISE
AFTER
CALAMITIES
AND
MISFORTUNES
FOR
THEY
ARE
AS
MEN
FALLEN
OUT
WITH
THE
TIMES
AND
THINK
OTHER
MEN
HARMS
REDEMPTION
OF
THEIR
OWN
SUFFERINGS
THEY
THAT
DESIRE
TO
EXCEL
IN
TOO
MANY
MATTERS
OUT
OF
LEVITY
AND
VAIN
GLORY
ARE
EVER
ENVIOUS
FOR
THEY
CANNOT
WANT
WORK
IT
BEING
IMPOSSIBLE
BUT
MANY
IN
SOME
ONE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
SHOULD
SURPASS
THEM
WHICH
WAS
THE
CHARACTER
OF
ADRIAN
THE
EMPEROR
THAT
MORTALLY
ENVIED
POETS
AND
PAINTERS
AND
ARTIFICERS
IN
WORKS
WHEREIN
HE
HAD
VEIN
TO
EXCEL
LASTLY
NEAR
KINSFOLKS
AND
FELLOWS
IN
OFFICE
AND
THOSE
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
BRED
TOGETHER
ARE
MORE
APT
TO
ENVY
THEIR
EQUALS
WHEN
THEY
ARE
RAISED
FOR
IT
DOTH
UPBRAID
UNTO
THEM
THEIR
OWN
FORTUNES
AND
POINTETH
AT
THEM
AND
COMETH
OFTENER
INTO
THEIR
REMEMBRANCE
AND
INCURRETH
LIKEWISE
MORE
INTO
THE
NOTE
OF
OTHERS
AND
ENVY
EVER
REDOUBLETH
FROM
SPEECH
AND
FAME
CAIN
ENVY
WAS
THE
MORE
VILE
AND
MALIGNANT
TOWARDS
HIS
BROTHER
ABEL
BECAUSE
WHEN
HIS
SACRIFICE
WAS
BETTER
ACCEPTED
THERE
WAS
NO
BODY
TO
LOOK
ON
THUS
MUCH
FOR
THOSE
THAT
ARE
APT
TO
ENVY
CONCERNING
THOSE
THAT
ARE
MORE
OR
LESS
SUBJECT
TO
ENVY
FIRST
PERSONS
OF
EMINENT
VIRTUE
WHEN
THEY
ARE
ADVANCED
ARE
LESS
ENVIED
FOR
THEIR
FORTUNE
SEEMETH
BUT
DUE
UNTO
THEM
AND
NO
MAN
ENVIETH
THE
PAYMENT
OF
DEBT
BUT
REWARDS
AND
LIBERALITY
RATHER
AGAIN
ENVY
IS
EVER
JOINED
WITH
THE
COMPARING
OF
MAN
SELF
AND
WHERE
THERE
IS
NO
COMPARISON
NO
ENVY
AND
THEREFORE
KINGS
ARE
NOT
ENVIED
BUT
BY
KINGS
NEVERTHELESS
IT
IS
TO
BE
NOTED
THAT
UNWORTHY
PERSONS
ARE
MOST
ENVIED
AT
THEIR
FIRST
COMING
IN
AND
AFTERWARDS
OVERCOME
IT
BETTER
WHEREAS
CONTRARIWISE
PERSONS
OF
WORTH
AND
MERIT
ARE
MOST
ENVIED
WHEN
THEIR
FORTUNE
CONTINUETH
LONG
FOR
BY
THAT
TIME
THOUGH
THEIR
VIRTUE
BE
THE
SAME
YET
IT
HATH
NOT
THE
SAME
LUSTRE
FOR
FRESH
MEN
GROW
UP
THAT
DARKEN
IT
PERSONS
OF
NOBLE
BLOOD
ARE
LESS
ENVIED
IN
THEIR
RISING
FOR
IT
SEEMETH
BUT
RIGHT
DONE
TO
THEIR
BIRTH
BESIDES
THERE
SEEMETH
NOT
MUCH
ADDED
TO
THEIR
FORTUNE
AND
ENVY
IS
AS
THE
SUNBEAMS
THAT
BEAT
HOTTER
UPON
BANK
OR
STEEP
RISING
GROUND
THAN
UPON
FLAT
AND
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
THOSE
THAT
ARE
ADVANCED
BY
DEGREES
ARE
LESS
ENVIED
THAN
THOSE
THAT
ARE
ADVANCED
SUDDENLY
AND
PER
SALTUM
THOSE
THAT
HAVE
JOINED
WITH
THEIR
HONOR
GREAT
TRAVELS
CARES
OR
PERILS
ARE
LESS
SUBJECT
TO
ENVY
FOR
MEN
THINK
THAT
THEY
EARN
THEIR
HONORS
HARDLY
AND
PITY
THEM
SOMETIMES
AND
PITY
EVER
HEALETH
ENVY
WHEREFORE
YOU
SHALL
OBSERVE
THAT
THE
MORE
DEEP
AND
SOBER
SORT
OF
POLITIC
PERSONS
IN
THEIR
GREATNESS
ARE
EVER
BEMOANING
THEMSELVES
WHAT
LIFE
THEY
LEAD
CHANTING
QUANTA
PATIMUR
NOT
THAT
THEY
FEEL
IT
SO
BUT
ONLY
TO
ABATE
THE
EDGE
OF
ENVY
BUT
THIS
IS
TO
BE
UNDERSTOOD
OF
BUSINESS
THAT
IS
LAID
UPON
MEN
AND
NOT
SUCH
AS
THEY
CALL
UNTO
THEMSELVES
FOR
NOTHING
INCREASETH
ENVY
MORE
THAN
AN
UNNECESSARY
AND
AMBITIOUS
ENGROSSING
OF
BUSINESS
AND
NOTHING
DOTH
EXTINGUISH
ENVY
MORE
THAN
FOR
GREAT
PERSON
TO
PRESERVE
ALL
OTHER
INFERIOR
OFFICERS
IN
THEIR
FULL
LIGHTS
AND
PRE
EMINENCES
OF
THEIR
PLACES
FOR
BY
THAT
MEANS
THERE
BE
SO
MANY
SCREENS
BETWEEN
HIM
AND
ENVY
ABOVE
ALL
THOSE
ARE
MOST
SUBJECT
TO
ENVY
WHICH
CARRY
THE
GREATNESS
OF
THEIR
FORTUNES
IN
AN
INSOLENT
AND
PROUD
MANNER
BEING
NEVER
WELL
BUT
WHILE
THEY
ARE
SHOWING
HOW
GREAT
THEY
ARE
EITHER
BY
OUTWARD
POMP
OR
BY
TRIUMPHING
OVER
ALL
OPPOSITION
OR
COMPETITION
WHEREAS
WISE
MEN
WILL
RATHER
DO
SACRIFICE
TO
ENVY
IN
SUFFERING
THEMSELVES
SOMETIMES
OF
PURPOSE
TO
BE
CROSSED
AND
OVERBORNE
IN
THINGS
THAT
DO
NOT
MUCH
CONCERN
THEM
NOTWITHSTANDING
SO
MUCH
IS
TRUE
THAT
THE
CARRIAGE
OF
GREATNESS
IN
PLAIN
AND
OPEN
MANNER
SO
IT

WITHOUT
ARROGANCY
AND
VAIN
GLORY
DOTH
DRAW
LESS
ENVY
THAN
IF
IT
BE
IN
MORE
CRAFTY
AND
CUNNING
FASHION
FOR
IN
THAT
COURSE
MAN
DOTH
BUT
DISAVOW
FORTUNE
AND
SEEMETH
TO
BE
CONSCIOUS
OF
HIS
OWN
WANT
IN
WORTH
AND
DOTH
BUT
TEACH
OTHERS
TO
ENVY
HIM
LASTLY
TO
CONCLUDE
THIS
PART
AS
WE
SAID
IN
THE
BEGINNING
THAT
THE
ACT
OF
ENVY
HAD
SOMEWHAT
IN
IT
OF
WITCHCRAFT
SO
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
CURE
OF
ENVY
BUT
THE
CURE
OF
WITCHCRAFT
AND
THAT
IS
TO
REMOVE
THE
LOT
AS
THEY
CALL
IT
AND
TO
LAY
IT
UPON
ANOTHER
FOR
WHICH
PURPOSE
THE
WISER
SORT
OF
GREAT
PERSONS
BRING
IN
EVER
UPON
THE
STAGE
SOMEBODY
UPON
WHOM
TO
DERIVE
THE
ENVY
THAT
WOULD
COME
UPON
THEMSELVES
SOMETIMES
UPON
MINISTERS
AND
SERVANTS
SOMETIMES
UPON
COLLEAGUES
AND
ASSOCIATES
AND
THE
LIKE
AND
FOR
THAT
TURN
THERE
ARE
NEVER
WANTING
SOME
PERSONS
OF
VIOLENT
AND
UNDERTAKING
NATURES
WHO
SO
THEY
MAY
HAVE
POWER
AND
BUSINESS
WILL
TAKE
IT
AT
ANY
COST
NOW
TO
SPEAK
OF
PUBLIC
ENVY
THERE
IS
YET
SOME
GOOD
IN
PUBLIC
ENVY
WHEREAS
IN
PRIVATE
THERE
IS
NONE
FOR
PUBLIC
ENVY
IS
AS
AN
OSTRACISM
THAT
ECLIPSETH
MEN
WHEN
THEY
GROW
TOO
GREAT
AND
THEREFORE
IT
IS
BRIDLE
ALSO
TO
GREAT
ONES
TO
KEEP
THEM
WITHIN
BOUNDS
THIS
ENVY
BEING
IN
THE
LATIN
WORD
INVIDIA
GOETH
IN
THE
MODERN
LANGUAGE
BY
THE
NAME
OF
DISCONTENTMENT
OF
WHICH
WE
SHALL
SPEAK
IN
HANDLING
SEDITION
IT
IS
DISEASE
IN
STATE
LIKE
TO
INFECTION
FOR
AS
INFECTION
SPREADETH
UPON
THAT
WHICH
IS
SOUND
AND
TAINTETH
IT
SO
WHEN
ENVY
IS
GOTTEN
ONCE
INTO
STATE
IT
TRADUCETH
EVEN
THE
BEST
ACTIONS
THEREOF
AND
TURNETH
THEM
INTO
AN
ILL
ODOR
AND
THEREFORE
THERE
IS
LITTLE
WON
BY
INTERMINGLING
OF
PLAUSIBLE
ACTIONS
FOR
THAT
DOTH
ARGUE
BUT
WEAKNESS
AND
FEAR
OF
ENVY
WHICH
HURTETH
SO
MUCH
THE
MORE
AS
IT
IS
LIKEWISE
USUAL
IN
INFECTIONS
WHICH
IF
YOU
FEAR
THEM
YOU
CALL
THEM
UPON
YOU
THIS
PUBLIC
ENVY
SEEMETH
TO
BEAT
CHIEFLY
UPON
PRINCIPAL
OFFICERS
OR
MINISTERS
RATHER
THAN
UPON
KINGS
AND
ESTATES
THEMSELVES
BUT
THIS
IS
SURE
RULE
THAT
IF
THE
ENVY
UPON
THE
MINISTER
BE
GREAT
WHEN
THE
CAUSE
OF
IT
IN
HIM
IS
SMALL
OR
IF
THE
ENVY
BE
GENERAL
IN
MANNER
UPON
ALL
THE
MINISTERS
OF
AN
ESTATE
THEN
THE
ENVY
THOUGH
HIDDEN
IS
TRULY
UPON
THE
STATE
ITSELF
AND
SO
MUCH
OF
PUBLIC
ENVY
OR
DISCONTENTMENT
AND
THE
DIFFERENCE
THEREOF
FROM
PRIVATE
ENVY
WHICH
WAS
HANDLED
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
WE
WILL
ADD
THIS
IN
GENERAL
TOUCHING
THE
AFFECTION
OF
ENVY
THAT
OF
ALL
OTHER
AFFECTIONS
IT
IS
THE
MOST
IMPORTUNE
AND
CONTINUAL
FOR
OF
OTHER
AFFECTIONS
THERE
IS
OCCASION
GIVEN
BUT
NOW
AND
THEN
AND
THEREFORE
IT
WAS
WELL
SAID
INVIDIA
FESTOS
DIES
NON
AGIT
FOR
IT
IS
EVER
WORKING
UPON
SOME
OR
OTHER
AND
IT
IS
ALSO
NOTED
THAT
LOVE
AND
ENVY
DO
MAKE
MAN
PINE
WHICH
OTHER
AFFECTIONS
DO
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
SO
CONTINUAL
IT
IS
ALSO
THE
VILEST
AFFECTION
AND
THE
MOST
DEPRAVED
FOR
WHICH
CAUSE
IT
IS
THE
PROPER
ATTRIBUTE
OF
THE
DEVIL
WHO
IS
CALLED
THE
ENVIOUS
MAN
THAT
SOWETH
TARES
AMONGST
THE
WHEAT
BY
NIGHT
AS
IT
ALWAYS
COMETH
TO
PASS
THAT
ENVY
WORKETH
SUBTILLY
AND
IN
THE
DARK
AND
TO
THE
PREJUDICE
OF
GOOD
THINGS
SUCH
AS
IS
THE
WHEAT
OF
LOVE
THE
STAGE
IS
MORE
BEHOLDING
TO
LOVE
THAN
THE
LIFE
OF
MAN
FOR
AS
TO
THE
STAGE
LOVE
IS
EVER
MATTER
OF
COMEDIES
AND
NOW
AND
THEN
OF
TRAGEDIES
BUT
IN
LIFE
IT
DOTH
MUCH
MISCHIEF
SOMETIMES
LIKE
SIREN
SOMETIMES
LIKE
FURY
YOU
MAY
OBSERVE
THAT
AMONGST
ALL
THE
GREAT
AND
WORTHY
PERSONS
WHEREOF
THE
MEMORY
REMAINETH
EITHER
ANCIENT
OR
RECENT
THERE
IS
NOT
ONE
THAT
HATH
BEEN
TRANSPORTED
TO
THE
MAD
DEGREE
OF
LOVE
WHICH
SHOWS
THAT
GREAT
SPIRITS
AND
GREAT
BUSINESS
DO
KEEP
OUT
THIS
WEAK
PASSION
YOU
MUST
EXCEPT
NEVERTHELESS
MARCUS
ANTONIUS
THE
HALF
PARTNER
OF
THE
EMPIRE
OF
ROME
AND
APPIUS
CLAUDIUS
THE
DECEMVIR
AND
LAWGIVER
WHEREOF
THE
FORMER
WAS
INDEED
VOLUPTUOUS
MAN
AND
INORDINATE
BUT
THE
LATTER
WAS
AN
AUSTERE
AND
WISE
MAN
AND
THEREFORE
IT
SEEMS
THOUGH
RARELY
THAT
LOVE
CAN
FIND
ENTRANCE
NOT
ONLY
INTO
AN
OPEN
HEART
BUT
ALSO
INTO
HEART
WELL
FORTIFIED
IF
WATCH
BE
NOT
WELL
KEPT
IT
IS
POOR
SAYING
OF
EPICURUS
SATIS
MAGNUM
ALTER
ALTERI
THEATRUM
SUMUS
AS
IF
MAN
MADE
FOR
THE
CONTEMPLATION
OF
HEAVEN
AND
ALL
NOBLE
OBJECTS
SHOULD
DO
NOTHING
BUT
KNEEL
BEFORE
LITTLE
IDOL
AND
MAKE
HIMSELF
SUBJECT
THOUGH
NOT
OF
THE
MOUTH
AS
BEASTS
ARE
YET
OF
THE
EYE
WHICH
WAS
GIVEN
HIM
FOR
HIGHER
PURPOSES
IT
IS
STRANGE
THING
TO
NOTE
THE
EXCESS
OF
THIS
PASSION
AND
HOW
IT
BRAVES
THE
NATURE
AND
VALUE
OF
THINGS
BY
THIS
THAT
THE
SPEAKING
IN
PERPETUAL
HYPERBOLE
IS
COMELY
IN
NOTHING
BUT
IN
LOVE
NEITHER
IS
IT
MERELY
IN
THE
PHRASE
FOR
WHEREAS
IT
HATH
BEEN
WELL
SAID
THAT
THE
ARCH
FLATTERER
WITH
WHOM
ALL
THE
PETTY
FLATTERERS
HAVE
INTELLIGENCE
IS
MAN
SELF
CERTAINLY
THE
LOVER
IS
MORE
FOR
THERE
WAS
NEVER
PROUD
MAN
THOUGHT
SO
ABSURDLY
WELL
OF
HIMSELF
AS
THE
LOVER
DOTH
OF
THE
PERSON
LOVED
AND
THEREFORE
IT
WAS
WELL
SAID
THAT
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
LOVE
AND
TO
BE
WISE
NEITHER
DOTH
THIS
WEAKNESS
APPEAR
TO
OTHERS
ONLY
AND
NOT
TO
THE
PARTY
LOVED
BUT
TO
THE
LOVED
MOST
OF
ALL
EXCEPT
THE
LOVE
BE
RECIPROQUE
FOR
IT
IS
TRUE
RULE
THAT
LOVE
IS
EVER
REWARDED
EITHER
WITH
THE
RECIPROQUE
OR
WITH
AN
INWARD
AND
SECRET
CONTEMPT
BY
HOW
MUCH
THE
MORE
MEN
OUGHT
TO
BEWARE
OF
THIS
PASSION
WHICH
LOSETH
NOT
ONLY
OTHER
THINGS
BUT
ITSELF
AS
FOR
THE
OTHER
LOSSES
THE
POET
RELATION
DOTH
WELL
FIGURE
THEM
THAT
HE
THAT
PREFERRED
HELENA
QUITTED
THE
GIFTS
OF
JUNO
AND
PALLAS
FOR
WHOSOEVER
ESTEEMETH
TOO
MUCH
OF
AMOROUS
AFFECTION
QUITTETH
BOTH
RICHES
AND
WISDOM
THIS
PASSION
HATH
HIS
FLOODS
IN
VERY
TIMES
OF
WEAKNESS
WHICH
ARE
GREAT
PROSPERITY
AND
GREAT
ADVERSITY
THOUGH
THIS
LATTER
HATH
BEEN
LESS
OBSERVED
BOTH
WHICH
TIMES
KINDLE
LOVE
AND
MAKE
IT
MORE
FERVENT
AND
THEREFORE
SHOW
IT
TO
BE
THE
CHILD
OF
FOLLY
THEY
DO
BEST
WHO
IF
THEY
CANNOT
BUT
ADMIT
LOVE
YET
MAKE
IT
KEEP
QUARTERS
AND
SEVER
IT
WHOLLY
FROM
THEIR
SERIOUS
AFFAIRS
AND

OF
LIFE
FOR
IF
IT
CHECK
ONCE
WITH

IT
TROUBLETH
MEN
FORTUNES
AND
MAKETH
MEN
THAT
THEY
CAN
NO
WAYS
BE
TRUE
TO
THEIR
OWN
ENDS
KNOW
NOT
HOW
BUT
MARTIAL
MEN
ARE
GIVEN
TO
LOVE
THINK
IT
IS
BUT
AS
THEY
ARE
GIVEN
TO
WINE
FOR
PERILS
COMMONLY
ASK
TO
BE
PAID
IN
PLEASURES
THERE
IS
IN
MAN
NATURE
SECRET
INCLINATION
AND
MOTION
TOWARDS
LOVE
OF
OTHERS
WHICH
IF
IT
BE
NOT
SPENT
UPON
SOME
ONE
OR

DOTH
NATURALLY
SPREAD
ITSELF
TOWARDS
MANY
AND
MAKETH
MEN
BECOME
HUMANE
AND
CHARITABLE
AS
IT
IS
SEEN
SOMETIME
IN
FRIARS
NUPTIAL
LOVE
MAKETH
MANKIND
FRIENDLY
LOVE
PERFECTETH
IT
BUT
WANTON
LOVE
CORRUPTETH
AND
EMBASETH
IT
OF
GREAT
PLACE
MEN
IN
GREAT
PLACE
ARE
THRICE
SERVANTS
SERVANTS
OF
THE
SOVEREIGN
OR

SERVANTS
OF

SERVANTS
OF
BUSINESS
SO
AS
THEY
HAVE
NO
FREEDOM
NEITHER
IN
THEIR
PERSONS
NOR
IN
THEIR
ACTIONS
NOR
IN
THEIR
TIMES
IT
IS
STRANGE
DESIRE
TO
SEEK
POWER
AND
TO
LOSE
LIBERTY
OR
TO
SEEK
POWER
OVER
OTHERS
AND
TO
LOSE
POWER
OVER
MAN
SELF
THE
RISING
UNTO

IS
LABORIOUS
AND
BY
PAINS
MEN
COME
TO
GREATER
PAINS
AND
IT
IS
SOMETIMES
BASE
AND
BY
INDIGNITIES
MEN
COME
TO
DIGNITIES
THE
STANDING
IS
SLIPPERY
AND
THE
REGRESS
IS
EITHER
DOWNFALL

AT

AN
ECLIPSE
WHICH
IS
MELANCHOLY

MEN

THEY
WHEN

ARE
IMPATIENT
OF
PRIVATENESS
EVEN
IN
AGE
AND
SICKNESS
WHICH
REQUIRE
THE

THAT
WILL
BE
STILL
SITTING
AT
THEIR

THOUGH
THEREBY
THEY
OFFER
AGE
TO

CERTAINLY
GREAT

HAD

OTHER
MEN
OPINIONS
TO
THINK
THEMSELVES
HAPPY
FOR
IF
THEY
JUDGE
BY
THEIR

FEELING
THEY
CANNOT

BUT
IF

WITH
THEMSELVES
WHAT
OTHER

THINK
OF

AND
THAT
OTHER

WOULD
FAIN
BE
AS
THEY
ARE
THEN
THEY
ARE
HAPPY
AS
IT
WERE
BY

WHEN
PERHAPS
THEY

FOR
THEY
ARE
THE

THAT

THOUGH
THEY

THE

THAT

CERTAINLY
MEN
IN

STRANGERS
TO

AND

HE

IT

TRIVIAL
GRAMMAR

HE

THAT

NO

COMMENDED
STRANGE

THAT
THAT
PART

WHICH
IS

SUPERFICIAL

RATHER
THE

THE
REASON
IS
PLAIN
THERE
IS
IN

GENERALLY
MORE
OF
THE

OF
THE
WISE
AND
THEREFORE
THOSE
FACULTIES
BY
WHICH
THE
FOOLISH
PART
OF
MEN
MINDS
IS
TAKEN
ARE
MOST
POTENT
WONDERFUL
LIKE
IS
THE
CASE
OF

IN

WHAT
FIRST
BOLDNESS
WHAT
SECOND

THIRD
BOLDNESS
AND
YET
BOLDNESS
IS
CHILD
OF
IGNORANCE

FAR
INFERIOR

NEVERTHELESS
IT
DOTH
FASCINATE
AND
BIND
HAND
AND
FOOT
THOSE
THAT
ARE
EITHER
SHALLOW
IN
JUDGMENT
OR
WEAK
IN
COURAGE
WHICH
ARE
THE
GREATEST
PART
YEA
AND
PREVAILETH
WITH
WISE
MEN
AT
WEAK
TIMES
THEREFORE
WE
SEE
IT
HATH
DONE
WONDERS
IN
POPULAR
STATES
BUT
WITH
SENATES
AND
PRINCES
LESS
AND
MORE
EVER
UPON
THE
FIRST
ENTRANCE
OF
BOLD
PERSONS
INTO
ACTION
THAN
SOON
AFTER
FOR
BOLDNESS
IS
AN
ILL
KEEPER
OF
PROMISE
SURELY
AS
THERE
ARE
MOUNTEBANKS
FOR
THE
NATURAL
BODY
SO
ARE
THERE
MOUNTEBANKS
FOR
THE
POLITIC
BODY
MEN
THAT
UNDERTAKE
GREAT
CURES
AND
PERHAPS
HAVE
BEEN
LUCKY
IN
TWO
OR
THREE
EXPERIMENTS
BUT
WANT
THE
GROUNDS
OF
SCIENCE
AND
THEREFORE
CANNOT
HOLD
OUT
NAY
YOU
SHALL
SEE
BOLD
FELLOW
MANY
TIMES
DO
MAHOMET
MIRACLE
MAHOMET
MADE
THE
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
WOULD
CALL
AN
HILL
TO
HIM
AND
FROM
THE
TOP
OF
IT
OFFER
UP
HIS
PRAYERS
FOR
THE
OBSERVERS
OF
HIS
LAW
THE
PEOPLE
ASSEMBLED
MAHOMET
CALLED
THE
HILL
TO
COME
TO
HIM
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN
AND
WHEN
THE
HILL
STOOD
STILL
HE
WAS
NEVER
WHIT
ABASHED
BUT
SAID
IF
THE
HILL
WILL
NOT
COME
TO
MAHOMET
MAHOMET
WILL
GO
TO
THE
HILL
SO
THESE
MEN
WHEN
THEY
HAVE
PROMISED
GREAT
MATTERS
AND
FAILED
MOST
SHAMEFULLY
YET
IF
THEY
HAVE
THE
PERFECTION
OF
BOLDNESS
THEY
WILL
BUT
SLIGHT
IT
OVER
AND
MAKE
TURN
AND
NO
MORE
ADO
CERTAINLY
TO
MEN
OF
GREAT
JUDGMENT
BOLD
PERSONS
ARE
SPORT
TO
BEHOLD
NAY
AND
TO
THE
VULGAR
ALSO
BOLDNESS
HAS
SOMEWHAT
OF
THE
RIDICULOUS
FOR
IF
ABSURDITY
BE
THE
SUBJECT
OF
LAUGHTER
DOUBT
YOU
NOT
BUT
GREAT
BOLDNESS
IS
SELDOM
WITHOUT
SOME
ABSURDITY
ESPECIALLY
IT
IS
SPORT
TO
SEE
WHEN
BOLD
FELLOW
IS
OUT
OF
COUNTENANCE
FOR
THAT
PUTS
HIS
FACE
INTO
MOST
SHRUNKEN
AND
WOODEN
POSTURE
AS
NEEDS
IT
MUST
FOR
IN
BASHFULNESS
THE
SPIRITS
DO
LITTLE
GO
AND
COME
BUT
WITH
BOLD
MEN
UPON
LIKE
OCCASION
THEY
STAND
AT
STAY
LIKE
STALE
AT
CHESS
WHERE
IT
IS
NO
MATE
BUT
YET
THE
GAME
CANNOT
STIR
BUT
THIS
LAST
WERE
FITTER
FOR
SATIRE
THAN
FOR
SERIOUS
OBSERVATION
THIS
IS
WELL
TO
BE
WEIGHED
THAT
BOLDNESS
IS
EVER
BLIND
FOR
IT
SEETH
NOT
DANGER
AND
INCONVENIENCES
THEREFORE
IT
IS
ILL
IN
COUNSEL
GOOD
IN
EXECUTION
SO
THAT
THE
RIGHT
USE
OF
BOLD
PERSONS
IS
THAT
THEY
NEVER
COMMAND
IN
CHIEF
BUT
BE
SECONDS
AND
UNDER
THE
DIRECTION
OF
OTHERS
FOR
IN
COUNSEL
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
SEE
DANGERS
AND
IN
EXECUTION
NOT
TO
SEE
THEM
EXCEPT
THEY
BE
VERY
GREAT
OF
GOODNESS
AND
GOODNESS
OF
NATURE
TAKE
GOODNESS
IN
THIS
SENSE
THE
AFFECTING
OF
THE
WEAL
OF
MEN
WHICH
IS
THAT
THE
GRECIANS
CALL
PHILANTHROPIA
AND
THE
WORD
HUMANITY
AS
IT
IS
USED
IS
LITTLE
TOO
LIGHT
TO
EXPRESS
IT
GOODNESS
CALL
THE
HABIT
AND
GOODNESS
OF
NATURE
THE
INCLINATION
THIS
OF
ALL
VIRTUES
AND
DIGNITIES
OF
THE
MIND
IS
THE
GREATEST
BEING
THE
CHARACTER
OF
THE
DEITY
AND
WITHOUT
IT
MAN
IS
BUSY
MISCHIEVOUS
WRETCHED
THING
NO
BETTER
THAN
KIND
OF
VERMIN
GOODNESS
ANSWERS
TO
THE
THEOLOGICAL
VIRTUE
CHARITY
AND
ADMITS
NO
EXCESS
BUT
ERROR
THE
DESIRE
OF
POWER
IN
EXCESS
CAUSED
THE
ANGELS
TO
FALL
THE
DESIRE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
IN
EXCESS
CAUSED
MAN
TO
FALL
BUT
IN
CHARITY
THERE
IS
NO
EXCESS
NEITHER
CAN
ANGEL
NOR
MAN
COME
IN
DANGER
BY
IT
THE
INCLINATION
TO
GOODNESS
IS
IMPRINTED
DEEPLY
IN
THE
NATURE
OF
MAN
INSOMUCH
THAT
IF
IT
ISSUE
NOT
TOWARDS
MEN
IT
WILL
TAKE
UNTO
OTHER
LIVING
CREATURES
AS
IT
IS
SEEN
IN
THE
TURKS
CRUEL
PEOPLE
WHO
NEVERTHELESS
ARE
KIND
TO
BEASTS
AND
GIVE
ALMS
TO
DOGS
AND

INSOMUCH
AS
BUSBECHIUS

LONG

THE

AN

TANTO
BUON
CHE
VAL

SO
GOOD
THAT
HE
IS

FOR

AND
ONE
OF
THE
DOCTORS
OF

NICHOLAS
MACHIAVEL
HAD
THE
CONFIDENCE
TO
PUT
IN

ALMOST
IN

TERMS
THAT
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
HAD
GIVEN

GOOD
MEN
IN

TO
THOSE
THAT
ARE
TYRANNICAL
AND

WHICH
HE
SPAKE
BECAUSE
INDEED
THERE
WAS
NEVER
LAW
OR
SECT
OR

DID
SO
MUCH
MAGNIFY
GOODNESS
AS
THE
CHRISTIAN
RELIGION
DOTH
THEREFORE
TO
AVOID
THE
SCANDAL
AND
THE
DANGER
BOTH
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
TAKE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
ERRORS
OF
AN
HABIT
SO
EXCELLENT
SEEK
THE
GOOD
OF
OTHER
MEN
BUT
BE
NOT
IN

HE

NOT

EQUALLY
COMMON

WITH

AND
BEWARE
HOW
IN

MAKETH
THE

THE

NEITHER

THERE
IS

EVEN
IN

ON

THERE
IS
NATURAL
MALIGNITY
FOR
THERE
BE
THAT
IN

DO
NOT

THE
LIGHTER

BUT
TO
CRASSNESS
OR
FROWARDNESS
OR
APTNESS
TO
OPPOSE
OR
DIFFICULTIES
OR
THE

BUT
THE
DEEPER
SORT
TO
ENVY
AND
MERE
MISCHIEF
SUCH
MEN
IN
OTHER
MEN
CALAMITIES
ARE
AS
IT
WERE
IN
SEASON
AND
ARE
EVER
ON
THE
LOADING
PART
NOT
SO
GOOD
AS
THE
DOGS
THAT
LICKED
LAZARUS

BUT
LIKE
FLIES
THAT
ARE
STILL
BUZZING
UPON
ANY

THAT
IS

MISANTHROPI
THAT
MAKE
IT
THEIR

TO

TO
THE

AND

NEVER
TREE
FOR

IN

AS
TIMON

SUCH

ARE
THE

ERRORS
OF

AND
YET
THEY
ARE
THE
FITTEST
TIMBER
TO

GREAT

OF

TO

TIMBER
THAT
IS
GOOD
FOR
SHIPS
THAT
ARE
ORDAINED
TO
BE
TOSSED
BUT
NOT
FOR
BUILDING
HOUSES
THAT
SHALL
STAND
FIRM
THE
PARTS
AND
SIGNS
OF
GOODNESS
ARE
MANY
IF
MAN
BE
GRACIOUS
AND
COURTEOUS
TO
STRANGERS
IT
SHOWS
HE
IS
CITIZEN
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
THAT
HIS
HEART
IS
NO
ISLAND
CUT
OFF
FROM
OTHER
LANDS
BUT
CONTINENT
THAT
JOINS
TO
THEM
IF
HE
BE
COMPASSIONATE
TOWARDS
THE
AFFLICTIONS
OF
OTHERS
IT
SHOWS
THAT
HIS
HEART
IS
LIKE
THE
NOBLE
TREE
THAT
IS
WOUNDED
ITSELF
WHEN
IT
GIVES
THE
BALM
IF
HE
EASILY
PARDONS
AND
REMITS
OFFENCES
IT
SHOWS
THAT
HIS
MIND
IS
PLANTED
ABOVE
INJURIES
SO
THAT
HE
CANNOT
BE
SHOT
IF
HE
BE
THANKFUL
FOR
SMALL
BENEFITS
IT
SHOWS
THAT
HE
WEIGHS
MEN
MINDS
AND
NOT
THEIR
TRASH
BUT
ABOVE
ALL
IF
HE
HAVE
ST
PAUL
PERFECTION
THAT
HE
WOULD
WISH
TO
BE
ANATHEMA
FROM
CHRIST
FOR
THE
SALVATION
OF
HIS
BRETHREN
IT
SHOWS
MUCH
OF
DIVINE
NATURE
AND
KIND
OF
CONFORMITY
WITH
CHRIST
HIMSELF
OF
NOBILITY
WE
WILL
SPEAK
OF
NOBILITY
FIRST
AS

THEN
AS
CONDITION
OF

MONARCHY
WHERE
THERE

TYRANNY

SOVEREIGNTY
AND
DRAWS
THE
EYES
OF
THE

SOMEWHAT
ASIDE
FROM
THE
LINE
ROYAL
BUT
FOR
DEMOCRACIES
THEY
NEED
IT
NOT
AND
THEY
ARE
COMMONLY
MORE
QUIET
AND
LESS
SUBJECT
TO
SEDITION
THAN
WHERE
THERE
ARE
STIRPS
OF

FOR

EYES
ARE
UPON

OR
IF
UPON

IT
IS

SAKE
AS

WE
SEE
THE

WELL
NOTWITHSTANDING
THEIR

OF

THE

CHEERFUL
GREAT

NOBILITY
ADDETH
MAJESTY
TO

BUT
DIMINISHETH
POWER
AND
PUTTETH
LIFE
AND

INTO
THE

BUT

IT
IS
WELL
WHEN
NOBLES
ARE
NOT

GREAT
FOR

FOR

AND

MAINTAINED
IN

AS
THE

IT
BEING
OF

THAT
MANY
OF

IN

IT
MAKETH
KIND
OF
DISPROPORTION
BETWEEN

IT
IS
REVEREND
THING
TO

OF

FOR

THE

BUT
ANCIENT

THE
ACT
OF

THOSE
THAT
ARE
FIRST
RAISED
TO

ARE
COMMONLY
MORE
VIRTUOUS

LESS
INNOCENT
THAN
THEIR
DESCENDANTS
FOR
THERE
IS
RARELY
ANY

BUT
BY
COMMIXTURE
OF

IT
IS

THE

DIE
WITH

WELL
WHEN

MAKE

IT
IS
AS

THAT
IS
OVERTHROWN
BY

ON
THE

AS
WAS

SEEN
IN
THE

OF
HENRY
THE
THIRD
OF

FOR
FIRST
HIMSELF
ENTERED
LEAGUE
FOR
THE
EXTIRPATION
OF
THE
PROTESTANTS
AND
PRESENTLY
AFTER
THE
SAME
LEAGUE
WAS
TURNED
UPON
HIMSELF
FOR
WHEN
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
PRINCES
IS
MADE
BUT
AN
ACCESSORY
TO
CAUSE
AND
THAT
THERE
BE
OTHER
BANDS
THAT
TIE
FASTER
THAN
THE
BAND
OF
SOVEREIGNTY
KINGS
BEGIN
TO
BE
PUT
ALMOST
OUT
OF
POSSESSION
ALSO
WHEN
DISCORDS
AND
QUARRELS
AND
FACTIONS
ARE
CARRIED
OPENLY
AND
AUDACIOUSLY
IT
IS
SIGN
THE
REVERENCE
OF

IS
LOST
FOR
THE
MOTIONS
OF
THE
GREATEST
PERSONS
IN

OUGHT
TO

AS
THE
MOTIONS
OF
THE

UNDER

ACCORDING
TO
THE
OLD
OPINION
WHICH
IS
THAT
EVERY
OF
THEM
IS
CARRIED
SWIFTLY
BY
THE
HIGHEST
MOTION
AND
SOFTLY
IN
THEIR
OWN
MOTION
AND
THEREFORE
WHEN
GREAT
ONES
IN
THEIR
OWN
PARTICULAR
MOTION
MOVE
VIOLENTLY
AND
AS
TACITUS
EXPRESSETH
IT
WELL
LIBERIUS
QUAM
UT
IMPERANTIUM
MEMINISSENT
IT
IS
SIGN
THE
ORBS
ARE
OUT
OF
FRAME
FOR

IS
THAT
WHEREWITH
PRINCES
ARE
GIRT
FROM
GOD
WHO
THREATENETH
THE
DISSOLVING
THEREOF
SOLVAM
CINGULA
REGUM
SO
WHEN
ANY
OF
THE
FOUR
PILLARS
OF

ARE
MAINLY
SHAKEN
OR
WEAKENED
WHICH
ARE
RELIGION
JUSTICE
COUNSEL
AND
TREASURE
MEN
HAD
NEED
TO
PRAY
FOR
FAIR
WEATHER
BUT
LET
US
PASS
FROM
THIS
PART
OF
PREDICTIONS
CONCERNING
WHICH
NEVERTHELESS
MORE
LIGHT
MAY
BE
TAKEN
FROM
THAT
WHICH
FOLLOWETH
AND
LET
US
SPEAK
FIRST
OF
THE
MATERIALS
OF
SEDITIONS
THEN
OF
THE
MOTIVES
OF
THEM
AND
THIRDLY
OF
THE
REMEDIES
CONCERNING
THE
MATERIALS
OF
SEDITIONS
IT
IS
THING
WELL
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
FOR
THE
SUREST
WAY
TO
PREVENT
SEDITIONS
IF
THE
TIMES
DO
BEAR
IT
IS
TO
TAKE
AWAY
THE
MATTER
OF
THEM
FOR
IF
THERE
BE
FUEL
PREPARED
IT
IS
HARD
TO
TELL
WHENCE
THE
SPARK
SHALL
COME
THAT
SHALL
SET
IT
ON
FIRE
THE
MATTER
OF
SEDITIONS
IS
OF
TWO
KINDS
MUCH
POVERTY
AND
MUCH
DISCONTENTMENT

NOURISHING

NATIONESQUE
SUPERAVIMUS
OF
SUPERSTITION
IT
WERE
BETTER
TO
HAVE
NO
OPINION
OF
GOD
AT
ALL
THAN
SUCH
AN
OPINION
AS
IS
UNWORTHY
OF
HIM
FOR
THE
ONE
IS
UNBELIEF
THE
OTHER
IS
CONTUMELY
AND
CERTAINLY
SUPERSTITION
IS
THE
REPROACH
OF
THE
DEITY
PLUTARCH
SAITH
WELL
TO
THAT
PURPOSE
SURELY
SAITH
HE
HAD
RATHER
GREAT
DEAL
MEN
SHOULD
SAY
THERE
WAS
NO
SUCH
MAN
AT
ALL
AS
PLUTARCH
THAN
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
SAY
THAT
THERE
WAS
ONE
PLUTARCH
THAT
WOULD
EAT
HIS
CHILDREN
AS
SOON
AS
THEY
WERE
BORN
AS
THE
POETS
SPEAK
OF
SATURN
AND
AS
THE
CONTUMELY
IS
GREATER
TOWARDS
GOD
SO
THE
DANGER
IS
GREATER
TOWARDS
MEN
ATHEISM
LEAVES
MAN
TO
SENSE
TO
PHILOSOPHY
TO
NATURAL
PIETY
TO
LAWS
TO
REPUTATION
ALL
WHICH
MAY
BE
GUIDES
TO
AN
OUTWARD
MORAL
VIRTUE
THOUGH
RELIGION
WERE
NOT
BUT
SUPERSTITION
DISMOUNTS
ALL
THESE
AND
ERECTETH
AN
ABSOLUTE
MONARCHY
IN
THE
MINDS
OF
MEN
THEREFORE
ATHEISM
DID
NEVER
PERTURB
STATES
FOR
IT
MAKES
MEN
WARY
OF
THEMSELVES
AS
LOOKING
NO
FURTHER
AND
WE
SEE
THE
TIMES
INCLINED
TO
ATHEISM
AS
THE
TIME
OF
AUGUSTUS
CAESAR
WERE
CIVIL
TIMES
BUT
SUPERSTITION
HATH
BEEN
THE
CONFUSION
OF
MANY
STATES
AND
BRINGETH
IN
NEW
PRIMUM
MOBILE
THAT
RAVISHETH
ALL
THE
SPHERES
OF
GOVERNMENT
THE
MASTER
OF
SUPERSTITION
IS
THE
PEOPLE
AND
IN
ALL
SUPERSTITION
WISE
MEN
FOLLOW
FOOLS
AND
ARGUMENTS
ARE
FITTED
TO
PRACTICE
IN
REVERSED
ORDER
IT
WAS
GRAVELY
SAID
BY
SOME
OF
THE
PRELATES
IN
THE
COUNCIL
OF
TRENT
WHERE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
SCHOOLMEN
BARE
GREAT
SWAY
THAT
THE
SCHOOLMEN
WERE
LIKE
ASTRONOMERS
WHICH
DID
FEIGN
ECCENTRICS
AND
EPICYCLES
AND
SUCH
ENGINES
OF
ORBS
TO
SAVE
THE
PHENOMENA
THOUGH
THEY
KNEW
THERE
WERE
NO
SUCH
THINGS
AND
IN
LIKE
MANNER
THAT
THE
SCHOOLMEN
HAD
FRAMED
NUMBER
OF
SUBTLE
AND
INTRICATE
AXIOMS
AND
THEOREMS
TO
SAVE
THE
PRACTICE
OF
THE
CHURCH
THE
CAUSES
OF
SUPERSTITION
ARE
PLEASING
AND
SENSUAL
RITES
AND
CEREMONIES
EXCESS
OF
OUTWARD
AND
PHARISAICAL
HOLINESS
OVERGREAT
REVERENCE
OF
TRADITIONS
WHICH
CANNOT
BUT
LOAD
THE
CHURCH
THE
STRATAGEMS
OF
PRELATES
FOR
THEIR
OWN
AMBITION
AND
LUCRE
THE
FAVORING
TOO
MUCH
OF
GOOD
INTENTIONS
WHICH
OPENETH
THE
GATE
TO
CONCEITS
AND
NOVELTIES
THE
TAKING
AN
AIM
AT
DIVINE
MATTERS
BY
HUMAN
WHICH
CANNOT
BUT
BREED
MIXTURE
OF
IMAGINATIONS
AND
LASTLY
BARBAROUS
TIMES
ESPECIALLY
JOINED
WITH
CALAMITIES
AND
DISASTERS
SUPERSTITION
WITHOUT
VEIL
IS
DEFORMED
THING
FOR
AS
IT
ADDETH
DEFORMITY
TO
AN
APE
TO
BE
SO
LIKE
MAN
SO
THE
SIMILITUDE
OF
SUPERSTITION
TO
RELIGION
MAKES
IT
THE
MORE
DEFORMED
AND
AS
WHOLESOME
MEAT
CORRUPTETH
TO
LITTLE
WORMS
SO
GOOD
FORMS
AND
ORDERS
CORRUPT
INTO
NUMBER
OF
PETTY
OBSERVANCES
THERE
IS
SUPERSTITION
IN
AVOIDING
SUPERSTITION
WHEN
MEN
THINK
TO
DO
BEST
IF
THEY
GO
FURTHEST
FROM
THE
SUPERSTITION
FORMERLY
RECEIVED
THEREFORE
CARE
WOULD
BE
HAD
THAT
AS
IT
FARETH
IN
ILL
PURGINGS
THE
GOOD
BE
NOT
TAKEN
AWAY
WITH
THE
BAD
WHICH
COMMONLY
IS
DONE
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
IS
THE
REFORMER
OF
TRAVEL
TRAVEL
IN
THE
YOUNGER

IS
PART
OF

IN
THE
ELDER
PART
OF

HE
THAT
TRAVELLETH
INTO

BEFORE
HE
HATH
SOME

INTO

GOETH
TO

AND
NOT
TO

THAT
YOUNG

TRAVEL
UNDER

ALLOW
WELL
SO
THAT
HE
BE
SUCH
ONE
THAT
HATH

AND
HATH
BEEN
IN
THE

BEFORE
WHEREBY
HE
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO

WHAT

WHERE
THEY
GO
WHAT
ACQUAINTANCES
THEY
ARE
TO

WHAT
EXERCISES
OR
DISCIPLINE
THE
PLACE
YIELDETH
FOR
ELSE
YOUNG
MEN
SHALL
GO
HOODED
AND
LOOK
ABROAD
LITTLE
IT
IS
STRANGE
THING
THAT
IN
SEA
VOYAGES
WHERE
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
BE
SEEN
BUT
SKY
AND
SEA
MEN
SHOULD
MAKE
DIARIES
BUT
IN
LAND
TRAVEL
WHEREIN
SO
MUCH
IS
TO
BE
OBSERVED
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THEY
OMIT
IT
AS
IF
CHANCE
WERE
FITTER
TO
BE
REGISTERED
THAN
OBSERVATION
LET
DIARIES
THEREFORE
BE
BROUGHT
IN
USE
THE
THINGS
TO
BE
SEEN
AND
OBSERVED
ARE
THE
COURTS
OF
PRINCES
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THEY
GIVE
AUDIENCE
TO
AMBASSADORS
THE
COURTS
OF
JUSTICE
WHILE
THEY
SIT
AND
HEAR

AND
SO
OF

THE

WITH
THE

TO
CONCLUDE
WHATSOEVER
IS
MEMORABLE
IN
THE
PLACES
WHERE
THEY
GO
AFTER
ALL
WHICH
THE
TUTORS
OR

OUGHT
TO
MAKE
DILIGENT
INQUIRY
AS
FOR
TRIUMPHS
MASKS
FEASTS
WEDDINGS
FUNERALS
CAPITAL
EXECUTIONS
AND
SUCH
SHOWS
MEN
NEED
NOT
TO
BE
PUT
IN

OF
THEM
YET
ARE
THEY
NOT
TO
BE
NEGLECTED
IF
YOU
WILL
HAVE
YOUNG
MAN
TO
PUT
HIS
TRAVEL
INTO
LITTLE
ROOM
AND
IN
SHORT
TIME
TO
GATHER
MUCH
THIS
YOU
MUST
DO
FIRST
AS
WAS
SAID
HE
MUST
HAVE
SOME
ENTRANCE
INTO
THE
LANGUAGE
BEFORE
HE
GOETH
THEN
HE
MUST
HAVE
SUCH
SERVANT
OR
TUTOR
AS
KNOWETH
THE
COUNTRY
AS
WAS
LIKEWISE
SAID
LET
HIM
CARRY
WITH
HIM
ALSO
SOME
CARD
OR
BOOK
DESCRIBING
THE
COUNTRY
WHERE
HE
TRAVELLETH
WHICH
WILL
BE
GOOD
KEY
TO
HIS
INQUIRY
LET
HIM
KEEP
ALSO
DIARY
LET
HIM
NOT
STAY
LONG
IN
ONE
CITY
OR
TOWN
MORE
OR
LESS
AS
THE
PLACE
DESERVETH
BUT
NOT
LONG
NAY
WHEN
HE
STAYETH
IN
ONE
CITY
OR
TOWN
LET
HIM
CHANGE
HIS
LODGING
FROM
ONE
END
AND
PART
OF
THE
TOWN
TO
ANOTHER
WHICH
IS
GREAT
ADAMANT
OF
ACQUAINTANCE
LET
HIM
SEQUESTER
HIMSELF
FROM
THE
COMPANY
OF
HIS
COUNTRYMEN
AND
DIET
IN
SUCH
PLACES
WHERE
THERE
IS
GOOD
COMPANY
OF
THE
NATION
WHERE
HE
TRAVELLETH
LET
HIM
UPON
HIS
REMOVES
FROM
ONE
PLACE
TO
ANOTHER
PROCURE
RECOMMENDATION
TO
SOME
PERSON
OF
QUALITY
RESIDING
IN
THE
PLACE
WHITHER
HE
REMOVETH
THAT
HE
MAY
USE
HIS
FAVOR
IN
THOSE
THINGS
HE
DESIRETH
TO
SEE
OR
KNOW
THUS
HE
MAY
ABRIDGE
HIS
TRAVEL
WITH
MUCH
PROFIT
AS
FOR
THE
ACQUAINTANCE
WHICH
IS
TO
BE
SOUGHT
IN
TRAVEL
THAT
WHICH
IS
MOST
OF
ALL
PROFITABLE
IS
ACQUAINTANCE
WITH
THE
SECRETARIES
AND
EMPLOYED
MEN
OF
AMBASSADORS
FOR
SO
IN
TRAVELLING
IN
ONE
COUNTRY
HE
SHALL
SUCK
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
MANY
LET
HIM
ALSO
SEE
AND
VISIT
EMINENT
PERSONS
IN
ALL
KINDS
WHICH
ARE
OF
GREAT
NAME
ABROAD
THAT
HE
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
HOW
THE
LIFE
AGREETH
WITH
THE
FAME
FOR
QUARRELS
THEY
ARE
WITH
CARE
AND
DISCRETION
TO
BE
AVOIDED
THEY
ARE
COMMONLY
FOR
MISTRESSES
HEALTHS
PLACE
AND
WORDS
AND
LET
MAN
BEWARE
HOW
HE
KEEPETH
COMPANY
WITH
CHOLERIC
AND
QUARRELSOME
PERSONS
FOR
THEY
WILL
ENGAGE
HIM
INTO
THEIR
OWN
QUARRELS
WHEN
TRAVELLER
RETURNETH
HOME
LET
HIM
NOT
LEAVE
THE
COUNTRIES
WHERE
HE
HATH
TRAVELLED
ALTOGETHER
BEHIND
HIM
BUT
MAINTAIN
CORRESPONDENCE
BY
LETTERS
WITH
THOSE
OF
HIS
ACQUAINTANCE
WHICH
ARE
OF
MOST
WORTH
AND
LET
HIS
TRAVEL
APPEAR
RATHER
IN
HIS
DISCOURSE
THAN
HIS
APPAREL
OR
GESTURE
AND
IN
HIS
DISCOURSE
LET
HIM
BE
RATHER
ADVISED
IN
HIS
ANSWERS
THAN
FORWARD
TO
TELL
STORIES
AND
LET
IT
APPEAR
THAT
HE
DOTH
NOT
CHANGE
HIS
COUNTRY
MANNERS
FOR
THOSE
OF
FOREIGN
PARTS
BUT
ONLY
PRICK
IN
SOME
FLOWERS
OF
THAT
HE
HATH
LEARNED
ABROAD
INTO
THE
CUSTOMS
OF
HIS
OWN
COUNTRY
OF
EMPIRE
IT
IS
MISERABLE
STATE
OF
MIND
TO
HAVE
FEW
THINGS
TO
DESIRE
AND
MANY
THINGS
TO
FEAR
AND
YET
THAT
COMMONLY
IS
THE
CASE
OF
KINGS
WHO
BEING
AT
THE
HIGHEST
WANT
MATTER
OF
DESIRE
WHICH
MAKES
THEIR
MINDS
MORE
LANGUISHING
AND
HAVE
MANY
REPRESENTATIONS
OF
PERILS
AND
SHADOWS
WHICH
MAKES
THEIR
MINDS
THE
LESS
CLEAR
AND
THIS
IS
ONE
REASON
ALSO
OF
THAT
EFFECT
WHICH
THE
SCRIPTURE
SPEAKETH
OF
THAT
THE
KING
HEART
IS
INSCRUTABLE
FOR
MULTITUDE
OF
JEALOUSIES
AND
LACK
OF
SOME
PREDOMINANT
DESIRE
THAT
SHOULD
MARSHAL
AND
PUT
IN
ORDER
ALL
THE
REST
MAKETH
ANY
MAN
HEART
HARD
TO
FIND
OR
SOUND
HENCE
IT
COMES
LIKEWISE
THAT
PRINCES
MANY
TIMES
MAKE
THEMSELVES
DESIRES
AND
SET
THEIR
HEARTS
UPON
TOYS
SOMETIMES
UPON
BUILDING
SOMETIMES
UPON
ERECTING
OF
AN
ORDER
SOMETIMES
UPON
THE
ADVANCING
OF
PERSON
SOMETIMES
UPON
OBTAINING
EXCELLENCY
IN
SOME
ART
OR
FEAT
OF
THE
HAND
AS
NERO
FOR
PLAYING
ON
THE
HARP
DOMITIAN
FOR
CERTAINTY
OF
THE
HAND
WITH
THE
ARROW
COMMODUS
FOR
PLAYING
AT
FENCE
CARACALLA
FOR
DRIVING
CHARIOTS
AND
THE
LIKE
THIS
SEEMETH
INCREDIBLE
UNTO
THOSE
THAT
KNOW
NOT
THE
PRINCIPLE
THAT
THE
MIND
OF
MAN
IS
MORE
CHEERED
AND
REFRESHED
BY
PROFITING
IN
SMALL
THINGS
THAN
BY
STANDING
AT
STAY
IN
GREAT
WE
SEE
ALSO
THAT
KINGS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
FORTUNATE
CONQUERORS
IN
THEIR
FIRST
YEARS
IT
BEING
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
THEM
TO
GO
FORWARD
INFINITELY
BUT
THAT
THEY
MUST
HAVE
SOME
CHECK
OR
ARREST
IN
THEIR
FORTUNES
TURN
IN
THEIR
LATTER
YEARS
TO
BE
SUPERSTITIOUS
AND
MELANCHOLY
AS
DID
ALEXANDER
THE
GREAT
DIOCLETIAN
AND
IN
OUR
MEMORY
CHARLES
THE
FIFTH
AND
OTHERS
FOR
HE
THAT
IS
USED
TO
GO
FORWARD
AND
FINDETH
STOP
FALLETH
OUT
OF
HIS
OWN
FAVOR
AND
IS
NOT
THE
THING
HE
WAS
TO
SPEAK
NOW
OF
THE
TRUE
TEMPER
OF
EMPIRE
IT
IS
THING
RARE
AND
HARD
TO
KEEP
FOR
BOTH
TEMPER
AND
DISTEMPER
CONSIST
OF
CONTRARIES
BUT
IT
IS
ONE
THING
TO
MINGLE
CONTRARIES
ANOTHER
TO
INTERCHANGE
THEM
THE
ANSWER
OF
APOLLONIUS
TO
VESPASIAN
IS
FULL
OF
EXCELLENT
INSTRUCTION
VESPASIAN
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
WAS
NERO
OVERTHROW
HE
ANSWERED
NERO
COULD
TOUCH
AND
TUNE
THE
HARP
WELL
BUT
IN
GOVERNMENT
SOMETIMES
HE
USED
TO
WIND
THE
PINS
TOO
HIGH
SOMETIMES
TO
LET
THEM
DOWN
TOO
LOW
AND
CERTAIN
IT
IS
THAT
NOTHING
DESTROYETH
AUTHORITY
SO
MUCH
AS
THE
UNEQUAL
AND
UNTIMELY
INTERCHANGE
OF
POWER
PRESSED
TOO
FAR
AND
RELAXED
TOO
MUCH
THIS
IS
TRUE
THAT
THE
WISDOM
OF
ALL
THESE
LATTER
TIMES
IN
PRINCES
AFFAIRS
IS
RATHER
FINE
DELIVERIES
AND
SHIFTINGS
OF
DANGERS
AND
MISCHIEFS
WHEN
THEY
ARE
NEAR
THAN
SOLID
AND
GROUNDED
COURSES
TO
KEEP
THEM
ALOOF
BUT
THIS
IS
BUT
TO
TRY
MASTERIES
WITH
FORTUNE
AND
LET
MEN
BEWARE
HOW
THEY
NEGLECT
AND
SUFFER
MATTER
OF
TROUBLE
TO
BE
PREPARED
FOR
NO
MAN
CAN
FORBID
THE
SPARK
NOR
TELL
WHENCE
IT
MAY
COME
THE
DIFFICULTIES
IN
PRINCES
BUSINESS
ARE
MANY
AND
GREAT
BUT
THE
GREATEST
DIFFICULTY
IS
OFTEN
IN
THEIR
OWN
MIND
FOR
IT
IS
COMMON
WITH
PRINCES
SAITH
TACITUS
TO
WILL
CONTRADICTORIES
SUNT
PLERUMQUE
REGUM
VOLUNTATES
VEHEMENTES
ET
INTER
SE
CONTRARIAE
FOR
IT
IS
THE
SOLECISM
OF
POWER
TO
THINK
TO
COMMAND
THE
END
AND
YET
NOT
TO
ENDURE
THE
MEAN
KINGS
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
THEIR
NEIGHBORS
THEIR
WIVES
THEIR
CHILDREN
THEIR
PRELATES
OR
CLERGY
THEIR
NOBLES
THEIR
SECOND
NOBLES
OR
GENTLEMEN
THEIR
MERCHANTS
THEIR
COMMONS
AND
THEIR
MEN
OF
WAR
AND
FROM
ALL
THESE
ARISE
DANGERS
IF
CARE
AND
CIRCUMSPECTION
BE
NOT
USED
FIRST
FOR
THEIR
NEIGHBORS
THERE
CAN
NO
GENERAL
RULE
BE
GIVEN
FOR
OCCASIONS
ARE
SO
VARIABLE
SAVE
ONE
WHICH
EVER
HOLDETH
WHICH
IS
THAT
PRINCES
DO
KEEP
DUE
SENTINEL
THAT
NONE
OF
THEIR
NEIGHBORS
DO
EVER
GROW
SO
BY
INCREASE
OF
TERRITORY
BY
EMBRACING
OF
TRADE
BY
APPROACHES
OR
THE
LIKE
AS
THEY
BECOME
MORE
ABLE
TO
ANNOY
THEM
THAN
THEY
WERE
AND
THIS
IS
GENERALLY
THE
WORK
OF
STANDING
COUNSELS
TO
FORESEE
AND
TO
HINDER
IT
DURING
THAT
TRIUMVIRATE
OF
KINGS
KING
HENRY
THE
EIGHTH
OF
ENGLAND
FRANCIS
THE
FIRST
KING
OF
FRANCE
AND
CHARLES
THE
FIFTH
EMPEROR
THERE
WAS
SUCH
WATCH
KEPT
THAT
NONE
OF
THE
THREE
COULD
WIN
PALM
OF
GROUND
BUT
THE
OTHER
TWO
WOULD
STRAIGHTWAYS
BALANCE
IT
EITHER
BY
CONFEDERATION
OR
IF
NEED
WERE
BY
WAR
AND
WOULD
NOT
IN
ANY
WISE
TAKE
UP
PEACE
AT
INTEREST
AND
THE
LIKE
WAS
DONE
BY
THAT
LEAGUE
WHICH
GUICCIARDINI
SAITH
WAS
THE
SECURITY
OF
ITALY
MADE
BETWEEN
FERDINANDO
KING
OF
NAPLES
LORENZIUS
MEDICI
AND
LUDOVICUS
SFORZA
POTENTATES
THE
ONE
OF
FLORENCE
THE
OTHER
OF
MILAN
NEITHER
IS
THE
OPINION
OF
SOME
OF
THE
SCHOOLMEN
TO
BE
RECEIVED
THAT
WAR
CANNOT
JUSTLY
BE
MADE
BUT
UPON
PRECEDENT
INJURY
OR
PROVOCATION
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
BUT
JUST
FEAR
OF
AN
IMMINENT
DANGER
THOUGH
THERE
BE
NO
BLOW
GIVEN
IS
LAWFUL
CAUSE
OF
WAR
FOR
THEIR
WIVES
THERE
ARE
CRUEL
EXAMPLES
OF
THEM
LIVIA
IS
INFAMED
FOR
THE
POISONING
OF
HER
HUSBAND
ROXALANA
SOLYMAN
WIFE
WAS
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
THAT
RENOWNED
PRINCE
SULTAN
MUSTAPHA
AND
OTHERWISE
TROUBLED
HIS
HOUSE
AND
SUCCESSION
EDWARD
THE
SECOND
OF
ENGLAND
HIS
QUEEN
HAD
THE
PRINCIPAL
HAND
IN
THE
DEPOSING
AND
MURDER
OF
HER
HUSBAND
THIS
KIND
OF
DANGER
IS
THEN
TO
BE
FEARED
CHIEFLY
WHEN
THE
WIVES
HAVE
PLOTS
FOR
THE
RAISING
OF
THEIR
OWN
CHILDREN
OR
ELSE
THAT
THEY
BE
ADVOUTRESSES
FOR
THEIR
CHILDREN
THE
TRAGEDIES
LIKEWISE
OF
DANGERS
FROM
THEM
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
AND
GENERALLY
THE
ENTERING
OF
FATHERS
INTO
SUSPICION
OF
THEIR
CHILDREN
HATH
BEEN
EVER
UNFORTUNATE
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
MUSTAPHA
THAT
WE
NAMED
BEFORE
WAS
SO
FATAL
TO
SOLYMAN
LINE
AS
THE
SUCCESSION
OF
THE
TURKS
FROM
SOLYMAN
UNTIL
THIS
DAY
IS
SUSPECTED
TO
BE
UNTRUE
AND
OF
STRANGE
BLOOD
FOR
THAT
SELYMUS
THE
SECOND
WAS
THOUGHT
TO
BE
SUPPOSITIOUS
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
CRISPUS
YOUNG
PRINCE
OF
RARE
TOWARDNESS
BY
CONSTANTINUS
THE
GREAT
HIS
FATHER
WAS
IN
LIKE
MANNER
FATAL
TO
HIS
HOUSE
FOR
BOTH
CONSTANTINUS
AND
CONSTANCE
HIS
SONS
DIED
VIOLENT
DEATHS
AND
CONSTANTIUS
HIS
OTHER
SON
DID
LITTLE
BETTER
WHO
DIED
INDEED
OF
SICKNESS
BUT
AFTER
THAT
JULIANUS
HAD
TAKEN
ARMS
AGAINST
HIM
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
DEMETRIUS
SON
TO
PHILIP
THE
SECOND
OF
MACEDON
TURNED
UPON
THE
FATHER
WHO
DIED
OF
REPENTANCE
AND
MANY
LIKE
EXAMPLES
THERE
ARE
BUT
FEW
OR
NONE
WHERE
THE
FATHERS
HAD
GOOD
BY
SUCH
DISTRUST
EXCEPT
IT
WERE
WHERE
THE
SONS
WERE
UP
IN
OPEN
ARMS
AGAINST
THEM
AS
WAS
SELYMUS
THE
FIRST
AGAINST
BAJAZET
AND
THE
THREE
SONS
OF
HENRY
THE
SECOND
KING
OF
ENGLAND
FOR
THEIR
PRELATES
WHEN
THEY
ARE
PROUD
AND
GREAT
THERE
IS
ALSO
DANGER
FROM
THEM
AS
IT
WAS
IN
THE
TIMES
OF
ANSELMUS
AND
THOMAS
BECKET
ARCHBISHOPS
OF
CANTERBURY
WHO
WITH
THEIR
CROZIERS
DID
ALMOST
TRY
IT
WITH
THE
KING
SWORD
AND
YET
THEY
HAD
TO
DEAL
WITH
STOUT
AND
HAUGHTY
KINGS
WILLIAM
RUFUS
HENRY
THE
FIRST
AND
HENRY
THE
SECOND
THE
DANGER
IS
NOT
FROM
THAT
STATE
BUT
WHERE
IT
HATH
DEPENDENCE
OF
FOREIGN
AUTHORITY
OR
WHERE
THE
CHURCHMEN
COME
IN
AND
ARE
ELECTED
NOT
BY
THE
COLLATION
OF
THE
KING
OR
PARTICULAR
PATRONS
BUT
BY
THE
PEOPLE
FOR
THEIR
NOBLES
TO
KEEP
THEM
AT
DISTANCE
IT
IS
NOT
AMISS
BUT
TO
DEPRESS
THEM
MAY
MAKE
KING
MORE
ABSOLUTE
BUT
LESS
SAFE
AND
LESS
ABLE
TO
PERFORM
ANY
THING
THAT
HE
DESIRES
HAVE
NOTED
IT
IN
MY
HISTORY
OF
KING
HENRY
THE
SEVENTH
OF
ENGLAND
WHO
DEPRESSED
HIS
NOBILITY
WHEREUPON
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
HIS
TIMES
WERE
FULL
OF
DIFFICULTIES
AND
TROUBLES
FOR
THE
NOBILITY
THOUGH
THEY
CONTINUED
LOYAL
UNTO
HIM
YET
DID
THEY
NOT
CO
OPERATE
WITH
HIM
IN
HIS
BUSINESS
SO
THAT
IN
EFFECT
HE
WAS
FAIN
TO
DO
ALL
THINGS
HIMSELF
FOR
THEIR
SECOND
NOBLES
THERE
IS
NOT
MUCH
DANGER
FROM
THEM
BEING
BODY
DISPERSED
THEY
MAY
SOMETIMES
DISCOURSE
HIGH
BUT
THAT
DOTH
LITTLE
HURT
BESIDES
THEY
ARE
COUNTERPOISE
TO
THE
HIGHER
NOBILITY
THAT
THEY
GROW
NOT
TOO
POTENT
AND
LASTLY
BEING
THE
MOST
IMMEDIATE
IN
AUTHORITY
WITH
THE
COMMON
PEOPLE
THEY
DO
BEST
TEMPER
POPULAR
COMMOTIONS
FOR
THEIR
MERCHANTS
THEY
ARE
VENA
PORTA
AND
IF
THEY
FLOURISH
NOT
KINGDOM
MAY
HAVE
GOOD
LIMBS
BUT
WILL
HAVE
EMPTY
VEINS
AND
NOURISH
LITTLE
TAXES
AND
IMPOSTS
UPON
THEM
DO
SELDOM
GOOD
TO
THE
KING
REVENUE
FOR
THAT
THAT
HE
WINS
IN
THE
HUNDRED
HE
LEESETH
IN
THE
SHIRE
THE
PARTICULAR
RATES
BEING
INCREASED
BUT
THE
TOTAL
BULK
OF
TRADING
RATHER
DECREASED
FOR
THEIR
COMMONS
THERE
IS
LITTLE
DANGER
FROM
THEM
EXCEPT
IT
BE
WHERE
THEY
HAVE
GREAT
AND
POTENT
HEADS
OR
WHERE
YOU
MEDDLE
WITH
THE
POINT
OF
RELIGION
OR
THEIR
CUSTOMS
OR
MEANS
OF
LIFE
FOR
THEIR
MEN
OF
WAR
IT
IS
DANGEROUS
STATE
WHERE
THEY
LIVE
AND
REMAIN
IN
BODY
AND
ARE
USED
TO
DONATIVES
WHEREOF
WE
SEE
EXAMPLES
IN
THE
JANIZARIES
AND
PRETORIAN
BANDS
OF
ROME
BUT
TRAININGS
OF
MEN
AND
ARMING
THEM
IN
SEVERAL
PLACES
AND
UNDER
SEVERAL
COMMANDERS
AND
WITHOUT
DONATIVES
ARE
THINGS
OF
DEFENCE
AND
NO
DANGER
PRINCES
ARE
LIKE
TO
HEAVENLY
BODIES
WHICH
CAUSE
GOOD
OR
EVIL
TIMES
AND
WHICH
HAVE
MUCH
VENERATION
BUT
NO
REST
ALL
PRECEPTS
CONCERNING
KINGS
ARE
IN
EFFECT
COMPREHENDED
IN
THOSE
TWO
REMEMBRANCES
MEMENTO
QUOD
ES
HOMO
AND
MEMENTO
QUOD
ES
DEUS
OR
VICE
DEI
THE
ONE
BRIDLETH
THEIR
POWER
AND
THE
OTHER
THEIR
WILL
OF
COUNSEL
THE
GREATEST
TRUST
BETWEEN
MAN
AND
MAN
IS
THE
TRUST
OF
GIVING
COUNSEL
FOR
IN
OTHER
CONFIDENCES
MEN
COMMIT
THE
PARTS
OF
LIFE
THEIR
LANDS
THEIR
GOODS
THEIR
CHILDREN
THEIR
CREDIT
SOME
PARTICULAR
AFFAIR
BUT
TO
SUCH
AS
THEY
MAKE
THEIR
COUNSELLORS
THEY
COMMIT
THE
WHOLE
BY
HOW
MUCH
THE
MORE
THEY
ARE
OBLIGED
TO
ALL
FAITH
AND
INTEGRITY
THE
WISEST
PRINCES
NEED
NOT
THINK
IT
ANY
DIMINUTION
TO
THEIR
GREATNESS
OR
DEROGATION
TO
THEIR
SUFFICIENCY
TO
RELY
UPON
COUNSEL
GOD
HIMSELF
IS
NOT
WITHOUT
BUT
HATH
MADE
IT
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
NAMES
OF
HIS
BLESSED
SON
THE
COUNSELLOR
SOLOMON
HATH
PRONOUNCED
THAT
IN
COUNSEL
IS
STABILITY
THINGS
WILL
HAVE
THEIR
FIRST
OR
SECOND
AGITATION
IF
THEY
BE
NOT
TOSSED
UPON
THE
ARGUMENTS
OF
COUNSEL
THEY
WILL
BE
TOSSED
UPON
THE
WAVES
OF
FORTUNE
AND
BE
FULL
OF
INCONSTANCY
DOING
AND
UNDOING
LIKE
THE
REELING
OF
DRUNKEN
MAN
SOLOMON
SON
FOUND
THE
FORCE
OF
COUNSEL
AS
HIS
FATHER
SAW
THE
NECESSITY
OF
IT
FOR
THE
BELOVED
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
WAS
FIRST
RENT
AND
BROKEN
BY
ILL
COUNSEL
UPON
WHICH
COUNSEL
THERE
ARE
SET
FOR
OUR
INSTRUCTION
THE
TWO
MARKS
WHEREBY
BAD
COUNSEL
IS
FOR
EVER
BEST
DISCERNED
THAT
IT
WAS
YOUNG
COUNSEL
FOR
THE
PERSON
AND
VIOLENT
COUNSEL
FOR
THE
MATTER
THE
ANCIENT
TIMES
DO
SET
FORTH
IN
FIGURE
BOTH
THE
INCORPORATION
AND
INSEPARABLE
CONJUNCTION
OF
COUNSEL
WITH
KINGS
AND
THE
WISE
AND
POLITIC
USE
OF
COUNSEL
BY
KINGS
THE
ONE
IN
THAT
THEY
SAY
JUPITER
DID
MARRY
METIS
WHICH
SIGNIFIETH
COUNSEL
WHEREBY
THEY
INTEND
THAT
SOVEREIGNTY
IS
MARRIED
TO
COUNSEL
THE
OTHER
IN
THAT
WHICH
FOLLOWETH
WHICH
WAS
THUS
THEY
SAY
AFTER
JUPITER
WAS
MARRIED
TO
METIS
SHE
CONCEIVED
BY
HIM
AND
WAS
WITH
CHILD
BUT
JUPITER
SUFFERED
HER
NOT
TO
STAY
TILL
SHE
BROUGHT
FORTH
BUT
EAT
HER
UP
WHEREBY
HE
BECAME
HIMSELF
WITH
CHILD
AND
WAS
DELIVERED
OF
PALLAS
ARMED
OUT
OF
HIS
HEAD
WHICH
MONSTROUS
FABLE
CONTAINETH
SECRET
OF
EMPIRE
HOW
KINGS
ARE
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
THEIR
COUNSEL
OF
STATE
THAT
FIRST
THEY
OUGHT
TO
REFER
MATTERS
UNTO
THEM
WHICH
IS
THE
FIRST
BEGETTING
OR
IMPREGNATION
BUT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
ELABORATE
MOULDED
AND
SHAPED
IN
THE
WOMB
OF
THEIR
COUNSEL
AND
GROW
RIPE
AND
READY
TO
BE
BROUGHT
FORTH
THAT
THEN
THEY
SUFFER
NOT
THEIR
COUNSEL
TO
GO
THROUGH
WITH
THE
RESOLUTION
AND
DIRECTION
AS
IF
IT
DEPENDED
ON
THEM
BUT
TAKE
THE
MATTER
BACK
INTO
THEIR
OWN
HANDS
AND
MAKE
IT
APPEAR
TO
THE
WORLD
THAT
THE
DECREES
AND
FINAL
DIRECTIONS
WHICH
BECAUSE
THEY
COME
FORTH
WITH
PRUDENCE
AND
POWER
ARE
RESEMBLED
TO
PALLAS
ARMED
PROCEEDED
FROM
THEMSELVES
AND
NOT
ONLY
FROM
THEIR
AUTHORITY
BUT
THE
MORE
TO
ADD
REPUTATION
TO
THEMSELVES
FROM
THEIR
HEAD
AND
DEVICE
LET
US
NOW
SPEAK
OF
THE
INCONVENIENCES
OF
COUNSEL
AND
OF
THE
REMEDIES
THE
INCONVENIENCES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
NOTED
IN
CALLING
AND
USING
COUNSEL
ARE
THREE
FIRST
THE
REVEALING
OF
AFFAIRS
WHEREBY
THEY
BECOME
LESS
SECRET
SECONDLY
THE
WEAKENING
OF
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
PRINCES
AS
IF
THEY
WERE
LESS
OF
THEMSELVES
THIRDLY
THE
DANGER
OF
BEING
UNFAITHFULLY
COUNSELLED
AND
MORE
FOR
THE
GOOD
OF
THEM
THAT
COUNSEL
THAN
OF
HIM
THAT
IS
COUNSELLED
FOR
WHICH
INCONVENIENCES
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ITALY
AND
PRACTICE
OF
FRANCE
IN
SOME
KINGS
TIMES
HATH
INTRODUCED
CABINET
COUNSELS
REMEDY
WORSE
THAN
THE
DISEASE
AS
TO
SECRECY
PRINCES
ARE
NOT
BOUND
TO
COMMUNICATE
ALL
MATTERS
WITH
ALL
COUNSELLORS
BUT
MAY
EXTRACT
AND
SELECT
NEITHER
IS
IT
NECESSARY
THAT
HE
THAT
CONSULTETH
WHAT
HE
SHOULD
DO
SHOULD
DECLARE
WHAT
HE
WILL
DO
BUT
LET
PRINCES
BEWARE
THAT
THE
UNSECRETING
OF
THEIR
AFFAIRS
COMES
NOT
FROM
THEMSELVES
AND
AS
FOR
CABINET
COUNSELS
IT
MAY
BE
THEIR
MOTTO
PLENUS
RIMARUM
SUM
ONE
FUTILE
PERSON
THAT
MAKETH
IT
HIS
GLORY
TO
TELL
WILL
DO
MORE
HURT
THAN
MANY
THAT
KNOW
IT
THEIR
DUTY
TO
CONCEAL
IT
IS
TRUE
THERE
BE
SOME
AFFAIRS
WHICH
REQUIRE
EXTREME
SECRECY
WHICH
WILL
HARDLY
GO
BEYOND
ONE
OR
TWO
PERSONS
BESIDES
THE
KING
NEITHER
ARE
THOSE
COUNSELS
UNPROSPEROUS
FOR
BESIDES
THE
SECRECY
THEY
COMMONLY
GO
ON
CONSTANTLY
IN
ONE
SPIRIT
OF
DIRECTION
WITHOUT
DISTRACTION
BUT
THEN
IT
MUST
BE
PRUDENT
KING
SUCH
AS
IS
ABLE
TO
GRIND
WITH
HANDMILL
AND
THOSE
INWARD
COUNSELLORS
HAD
NEED
ALSO
BE
WISE
MEN
AND
ESPECIALLY
TRUE
AND
TRUSTY
TO
THE
KING
ENDS
AS
IT
WAS
WITH
KING
HENRY
THE
SEVENTH
OF
ENGLAND
WHO
IN
HIS
GREAT
BUSINESS
IMPARTED
HIMSELF
TO
NONE
EXCEPT
IT
WERE
TO
MORTON
AND
FOX
FOR
WEAKENING
OF
AUTHORITY
THE
FABLE
SHOWETH
THE
REMEDY
NAY
THE
MAJESTY
OF
KINGS
IS
RATHER
EXALTED
THAN
DIMINISHED
WHEN
THEY
ARE
IN
THE
CHAIR
OF
COUNSEL
NEITHER
WAS
THERE
EVER
PRINCE
BEREAVED
OF
HIS
DEPENDENCES
BY
HIS
COUNSEL
EXCEPT
WHERE
THERE
HATH
BEEN
EITHER
AN
OVER
GREATNESS
IN
ONE
COUNSELLOR
OR
AN
OVER
STRICT
COMBINATION
IN
DIVERS
WHICH
ARE
THINGS
SOON
FOUND
AND
HOLPEN
FOR
THE
LAST
INCONVENIENCE
THAT
MEN
WILL
COUNSEL
WITH
AN
EYE
TO
THEMSELVES
CERTAINLY
NON
INVENIET
FIDEM
SUPER
TERRAM
IS
MEANT
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
TIMES
AND
NOT
OF
ALL
PARTICULAR
PERSONS
THERE
BE
THAT
ARE
IN
NATURE
FAITHFUL
AND
SINCERE
AND
PLAIN
AND
DIRECT
NOT
CRAFTY
AND
INVOLVED
LET
PRINCES
ABOVE
ALL
DRAW
TO
THEMSELVES
SUCH
NATURES
BESIDES
COUNSELLORS
ARE
NOT
COMMONLY
SO
UNITED
BUT
THAT
ONE
COUNSELLOR
KEEPETH
SENTINEL
OVER
ANOTHER
SO
THAT
IF
ANY
DO
COUNSEL
OUT
OF
FACTION
OR
PRIVATE
ENDS
IT
COMMONLY
COMES
TO
THE
KING
EAR
BUT
THE
BEST
REMEDY
IS
IF
PRINCES
KNOW
THEIR
COUNSELLORS
AS
WELL
AS
THEIR
COUNSELLORS
KNOW
THEM
PRINCIPIS
EST
VIRTUS
MAXIMA
NOSSE
SUOS
AND
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
COUNSELLORS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
TOO
SPECULATIVE
INTO
THEIR
SOVEREIGN
PERSON
THE
TRUE
COMPOSITION
OF
COUNSELLOR
IS
RATHER
TO
BE
SKILFUL
IN
THEIR
MASTER
BUSINESS
THAN
IN
HIS
NATURE
FOR
THEN
HE
IS
LIKE
TO
ADVISE
HIM
AND
NOT
FEED
HIS
HUMOR
IT
IS
OF
SINGULAR
USE
TO
PRINCES
IF
THEY
TAKE
THE
OPINIONS
OF
THEIR
COUNSEL
BOTH
SEPARATELY
AND
TOGETHER
FOR
PRIVATE
OPINION
IS
MORE
FREE
BUT
OPINION
BEFORE
OTHERS
IS
MORE
REVERENT
IN
PRIVATE
MEN
ARE
MORE
BOLD
IN
THEIR
OWN
HUMORS
AND
IN
CONSORT
MEN
ARE
MORE
OBNOXIOUS
TO
OTHERS
HUMORS
THEREFORE
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
TAKE
BOTH
AND
OF
THE
INFERIOR
SORT
RATHER
IN
PRIVATE
TO
PRESERVE
FREEDOM
OF
THE
GREATER
RATHER
IN
CONSORT
TO
PRESERVE
RESPECT
IT
IS
IN
VAIN
FOR
PRINCES
TO
TAKE
COUNSEL
CONCERNING
MATTERS
IF
THEY
TAKE
NO
COUNSEL
LIKEWISE
CONCERNING
PERSONS
FOR
ALL
MATTERS
ARE
AS
DEAD
IMAGES
AND
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
EXECUTION
OF
AFFAIRS
RESTETH
IN
THE
GOOD
CHOICE
OF
PERSONS
NEITHER
IS
IT
ENOUGH
TO
CONSULT
CONCERNING
PERSONS
SECUNDUM
GENERA
AS
IN
AN
IDEA
OR
MATHEMATICAL
DESCRIPTION
WHAT
THE
KIND
AND
CHARACTER
OF
THE
PERSON
SHOULD
BE
FOR
THE
GREATEST
ERRORS
ARE
COMMITTED
AND
THE
MOST
JUDGMENT
IS
SHOWN
IN
THE
CHOICE
OF
INDIVIDUALS
IT
WAS
TRULY
SAID
OPTIMI
CONSILIARII
MORTUI
BOOKS
WILL
SPEAK
PLAIN
WHEN
COUNSELLORS
BLANCH
THEREFORE
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
BE
CONVERSANT
IN
THEM
SPECIALLY
THE
BOOKS
OF
SUCH
AS
THEMSELVES
HAVE
BEEN
ACTORS
UPON
THE
STAGE
THE
COUNSELS
AT
THIS
DAY
IN
MOST
PLACES
ARE
BUT
FAMILIAR
MEETINGS
WHERE
MATTERS
ARE
RATHER
TALKED
ON
THAN
DEBATED
AND
THEY
RUN
TOO
SWIFT
TO
THE
ORDER
OR
ACT
OF
COUNSEL
IT
WERE
BETTER
THAT
IN
CAUSES
OF
WEIGHT
THE
MATTER
WERE
PROPOUNDED
ONE
DAY
AND
NOT
SPOKEN
TO
TILL
THE
NEXT
DAY
IN
NOCTE
CONSILIUM
SO
WAS
IT
DONE
IN
THE
COMMISSION
OF
UNION
BETWEEN
ENGLAND
AND
SCOTLAND
WHICH
WAS
GRAVE
AND
ORDERLY
ASSEMBLY
COMMEND
SET
DAYS
FOR
PETITIONS
FOR
BOTH
IT
GIVES
THE
SUITORS
MORE
CERTAINTY
FOR
THEIR
ATTENDANCE
AND
IT
FREES
THE
MEETINGS
FOR
MATTERS
OF
ESTATE
THAT
THEY
MAY
HOC
AGERE
IN
CHOICE
OF
COMMITTEES
FOR
RIPENING
BUSINESS
FOR
THE
COUNSEL
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
CHOOSE
INDIFFERENT
PERSONS
THAN
TO
MAKE
AN
INDIFFERENCY
BY
PUTTING
IN
THOSE
THAT
ARE
STRONG
ON
BOTH
SIDES
COMMEND
ALSO
STANDING
COMMISSIONS
AS
FOR
TRADE
FOR
TREASURE
FOR
WAR
FOR
SUITS
FOR
SOME
PROVINCES
FOR
WHERE
THERE
BE
DIVERS
PARTICULAR
COUNSELS
AND
BUT
ONE
COUNSEL
OF
ESTATE
AS
IT
IS
IN
SPAIN
THEY
ARE
IN
EFFECT
NO
MORE
THAN
STANDING
COMMISSIONS
SAVE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
GREATER
AUTHORITY
LET
SUCH
AS
ARE
TO
INFORM
COUNSELS
OUT
OF
THEIR
PARTICULAR
PROFESSIONS
AS
LAWYERS
SEAMEN
MINTMEN
AND
THE
LIKE
BE
FIRST
HEARD
BEFORE
COMMITTEES
AND
THEN
AS
OCCASION
SERVES
BEFORE
THE
COUNSEL
AND
LET
THEM
NOT
COME
IN
MULTITUDES
OR
IN
TRIBUNITIOUS
MANNER
FOR
THAT
IS
TO
CLAMOR
COUNSELS
NOT
TO
INFORM
THEM
LONG
TABLE
AND
SQUARE
TABLE
OR
SEATS
ABOUT
THE
WALLS
SEEM
THINGS
OF
FORM
BUT
ARE
THINGS
OF
SUBSTANCE
FOR
AT
LONG
TABLE
FEW
AT
THE
UPPER
END
IN
EFFECT
SWAY
ALL
THE
BUSINESS
BUT
IN
THE
OTHER
FORM
THERE
IS
MORE
USE
OF
THE
COUNSELLORS
OPINIONS
THAT
SIT
LOWER
KING
WHEN
HE
PRESIDES
IN
COUNSEL
LET
HIM
BEWARE
HOW
HE
OPENS
HIS
OWN
INCLINATION
TOO
MUCH
IN
THAT
WHICH
HE
PROPOUNDETH
FOR
ELSE
COUNSELLORS
WILL
BUT
TAKE
THE
WIND
OF
HIM
AND
INSTEAD
OF
GIVING
FREE
COUNSEL
SING
HIM
SONG
OF
PLACEBO
OF
DELAYS
FORTUNE
IS
LIKE
THE
MARKET
WHERE
MANY
TIMES
IF
YOU
CAN
STAY
LITTLE
THE
PRICE
WILL
FALL
AGAIN
IT
IS
SOMETIMES
LIKE
SIBYLLA
OFFER
WHICH
AT
FIRST
OFFERETH
THE
COMMODITY
AT
FULL
THEN
CONSUMETH
PART
AND
PART
AND
STILL
HOLDETH
UP
THE
PRICE
FOR
OCCASION
AS
IT
IS
IN
THE
COMMON
VERSE
TURNETH
BALD
NODDLE
AFTER
SHE
HATH
PRESENTED
HER
LOCKS
IN
FRONT
AND
NO
HOLD
TAKEN
OR
AT
LEAST
TURNETH
THE
HANDLE
OF
THE
BOTTLE
FIRST
TO
BE
RECEIVED
AND
AFTER
THE
BELLY
WHICH
IS
HARD
TO
CLASP
THERE
IS
SURELY
NO
GREATER
WISDOM
THAN
WELL
TO
TIME
THE
BEGINNINGS
AND
ONSETS
OF
THINGS
DANGERS
ARE
NO
MORE
LIGHT
IF
THEY
ONCE
SEEM
LIGHT
AND
MORE
DANGERS
HAVE
DECEIVED
MEN
THAN
FORCED
THEM
NAY
IT
WERE
BETTER
TO
MEET
SOME
DANGERS
HALF
WAY
THOUGH
THEY
COME
NOTHING
NEAR
THAN
TO
KEEP
TOO
LONG
WATCH
UPON
THEIR
APPROACHES
FOR
IF
MAN
WATCH
TOO
LONG
IT
IS
ODDS
HE
WILL
FALL
ASLEEP
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
TO
BE
DECEIVED
WITH
TOO
LONG
SHADOWS
AS
SOME
HAVE
BEEN
WHEN
THE
MOON
WAS
LOW
AND
SHONE
ON
THEIR
ENEMIES
BACK
AND
SO
TO
SHOOT
OFF
BEFORE
THE
TIME
OR
TO
TEACH
DANGERS
TO
COME
ON
BY
OVER
EARLY
BUCKLING
TOWARDS
THEM
IS
ANOTHER
EXTREME
THE
RIPENESS
OR
UNRIPENESS
OF
THE
OCCASION
AS
WE
SAID
MUST
EVER
BE
WELL
WEIGHED
AND
GENERALLY
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
COMMIT
THE
BEGINNINGS
OF
ALL
GREAT
ACTIONS
TO
ARGUS
WITH
HIS
HUNDRED
EYES
AND
THE
ENDS
TO
BRIAREUS
WITH
HIS
HUNDRED
HANDS
FIRST
TO
WATCH
AND
THEN
TO
SPEED
FOR
THE
HELMET
OF
PLUTO
WHICH
MAKETH
THE
POLITIC
MAN
GO
INVISIBLE
IS
SECRECY
IN
THE
COUNSEL
AND
CELERITY
IN
THE
EXECUTION
FOR
WHEN
THINGS
ARE
ONCE
COME
TO
THE
EXECUTION
THERE
IS
NO
SECRECY
COMPARABLE
TO
CELERITY
LIKE
THE
MOTION
OF
BULLET
IN
THE
AIR
WHICH
FLIETH
SO
SWIFT
AS
IT
OUTRUNS
THE
EYE
OF
CUNNING
WE
TAKE
CUNNING
FOR
SINISTER
OR
CROOKED
WISDOM
AND
CERTAINLY
THERE
IS
GREAT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CUNNING
MAN
AND
WISE
MAN
NOT
ONLY
IN
POINT
OF
HONESTY
BUT
IN
POINT
OF
ABILITY
THERE
BE
THAT
CAN
PACK
THE
CARDS
AND
YET
CANNOT
PLAY
WELL
SO
THERE
ARE
SOME
THAT
ARE
GOOD
IN
CANVASSES
AND
FACTIONS
THAT
ARE
OTHERWISE
WEAK
MEN
AGAIN
IT
IS
ONE
THING
TO
UNDERSTAND
PERSONS
AND
ANOTHER
THING
TO
UNDERSTAND
MATTERS
FOR
MANY
ARE
PERFECT
IN
MEN
HUMORS
THAT
ARE
NOT
GREATLY
CAPABLE
OF
THE
REAL
PART
OF
BUSINESS
WHICH
IS
THE
CONSTITUTION
OF
ONE
THAT
HATH
STUDIED
MEN
MORE
THAN
BOOKS
SUCH
MEN
ARE
FITTER
FOR
PRACTICE
THAN
FOR
COUNSEL
AND
THEY
ARE
GOOD
BUT
IN
THEIR
OWN
ALLEY
TURN
THEM
TO
NEW
MEN
AND
THEY
HAVE
LOST
THEIR
AIM
SO
AS
THE
OLD
RULE
TO
KNOW
FOOL
FROM
WISE
MAN
MITTE
AMBOS
NUDOS
AD
IGNOTOS
ET
VIDEBIS
DOTH
SCARCE
HOLD
FOR
THEM
AND
BECAUSE
THESE
CUNNING
MEN
ARE
LIKE
HABERDASHERS
OF
SMALL
WARES
IT
IS
NOT
AMISS
TO
SET
FORTH
THEIR
SHOP
IT
IS
POINT
OF
CUNNING
TO
WAIT
UPON
HIM
WITH
WHOM
YOU
SPEAK
WITH
YOUR
EYE
AS
THE
JESUITS
GIVE
IT
IN
PRECEPT
FOR
THERE
BE
MANY
WISE
MEN
THAT
HAVE
SECRET
HEARTS
AND
TRANSPARENT
COUNTENANCES
YET
THIS
WOULD
BE
DONE
WITH
DEMURE
ABASING
OF
YOUR
EYE
SOMETIMES
AS
THE
JESUITS
ALSO
DO
USE
ANOTHER
IS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
OBTAIN
OF
PRESENT
DESPATCH
YOU
ENTERTAIN
AND
AMUSE
THE
PARTY
WITH
WHOM
YOU
DEAL
WITH
SOME
OTHER
DISCOURSE
THAT
HE
BE
NOT
TOO
MUCH
AWAKE
TO
MAKE
OBJECTIONS
KNEW
COUNSELLOR
AND
SECRETARY
THAT
NEVER
CAME
TO
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
OF
ENGLAND
WITH
BILLS
TO
SIGN
BUT
HE
WOULD
ALWAYS
FIRST
PUT
HER
INTO
SOME
DISCOURSE
OF

THAT
SHE
MOUGHT
THE

THE
BILLS
THE
LIKE
SURPRISE
MAY
BE
MADE
BY
MOVING
THINGS
WHEN
THE
PARTY
IS
IN
HASTE
AND
CANNOT
STAY
TO
CONSIDER
ADVISEDLY
OF
THAT
IS
MOVED
IF
MAN
WOULD
CROSS
BUSINESS
THAT
HE
DOUBTS
SOME
OTHER
WOULD
HANDSOMELY
AND
EFFECTUALLY
MOVE
LET
HIM
PRETEND
TO
WISH
IT
WELL
AND
MOVE
IT
HIMSELF
IN
SUCH
SORT
AS
MAY
FOIL
IT
THE
BREAKING
OFF
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THAT
ONE
WAS
ABOUT
TO
SAY
AS
IF
HE
TOOK
HIMSELF
UP
BREEDS
GREATER
APPETITE
IN
HIM
WITH
WHOM
YOU
CONFER
TO
KNOW
MORE
AND
BECAUSE
IT
WORKS
BETTER
WHEN
ANYTHING
SEEMETH
TO
BE
GOTTEN
FROM
YOU
BY
QUESTION
THAN
IF
YOU
OFFER
IT
OF
YOURSELF
YOU
MAY
LAY
BAIT
FOR
QUESTION
BY
SHOWING
ANOTHER
VISAGE
AND
COUNTENANCE
THAN
YOU
ARE
WONT
TO
THE
END
TO
GIVE
OCCASION
FOR
THE
PARTY
TO
ASK
WHAT
THE
MATTER
IS
OF
THE
CHANGE
AS
NEHEMIAS
DID
AND
HAD
NOT
BEFORE
THAT
TIME
BEEN
SAD
BEFORE
THE
KING
IN
THINGS
THAT
ARE
TENDER
AND
UNPLEASING
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
BREAK
THE
ICE
BY
SOME
WHOSE
WORDS
ARE
OF
LESS
WEIGHT
AND
TO
RESERVE
THE
MORE
WEIGHTY
VOICE
TO
COME
IN
AS
BY
CHANCE
SO
THAT
HE
MAY
BE
ASKED
THE
QUESTION
UPON
THE
OTHER
SPEECH
AS
NARCISSUS
DID
RELATING
TO
CLAUDIUS
THE
MARRIAGE
OF
MESSALINA
AND
SILIUS
IN
THINGS
THAT
MAN
WOULD
NOT
BE
SEEN
IN
HIMSELF
IT
IS
POINT
OF
CUNNING
TO
BORROW
THE
NAME
OF
THE
WORLD
AS
TO
SAY
THE
WORLD
SAYS
OR
THERE
IS
SPEECH
ABROAD
KNEW
ONE
THAT
WHEN
HE
WROTE
LETTER
HE
WOULD
PUT
THAT
WHICH
WAS
MOST
MATERIAL
IN
THE
POSTSCRIPT
AS
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
BY
MATTER
KNEW
ANOTHER
THAT
WHEN
HE
CAME
TO
HAVE
SPEECH
HE
WOULD
PASS
OVER
THAT
THAT
HE
INTENDED
MOST
AND
GO
FORTH
AND
COME
BACK
AGAIN
AND
SPEAK
OF
IT
AS
OF
THING
THAT
HE
HAD
ALMOST
FORGOT
SOME
PROCURE
THEMSELVES
TO
BE
SURPRISED
AT
SUCH
TIMES
AS
IT
IS
LIKE
THE
PARTY
THAT
THEY
WORK
UPON
WILL
SUDDENLY
COME
UPON
THEM
AND
TO
BE
FOUND
WITH
LETTER
IN
THEIR
HAND
OR
DOING
SOMEWHAT
WHICH
THEY
ARE
NOT
ACCUSTOMED
TO
THE
END
THEY
MAY
BE
APPOSED
OF
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
OF
THEMSELVES
THEY
ARE
DESIROUS
TO
UTTER
IT
IS
POINT
OF
CUNNING
TO
LET
FALL
THOSE
WORDS
IN
MAN
OWN
NAME
WHICH
HE
WOULD
HAVE
ANOTHER
MAN
LEARN
AND
USE
AND
THEREUPON
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
KNEW
TWO
THAT
WERE
COMPETITORS
FOR
THE
SECRETARY
PLACE
IN
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
TIME
AND
YET
KEPT
GOOD
QUARTER
BETWEEN
THEMSELVES
AND
WOULD
CONFER
ONE
WITH
ANOTHER
UPON
THE
BUSINESS
AND
THE
ONE
OF
THEM
SAID
THAT
TO
BE
SECRETARY
IN
THE
DECLINATION
OF
MONARCHY
WAS
TICKLISH
THING
AND
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
AFFECT
IT
THE
OTHER
STRAIGHT
CAUGHT
UP
THOSE
WORDS
AND
DISCOURSED
WITH
DIVERS
OF
HIS
FRIENDS
THAT
HE
HAD
NO
REASON
TO
DESIRE
TO
BE
SECRETARY
IN
THE
DECLINATION
OF
MONARCHY
THE
FIRST
MAN
TOOK
HOLD
OF
IT
AND
FOUND
MEANS
IT
WAS
TOLD
THE
QUEEN
WHO
HEARING
OF
DECLINATION
OF
MONARCHY
TOOK
IT
SO
ILL
AS
SHE
WOULD
NEVER
AFTER
HEAR
OF
THE
OTHER
SUIT
THERE
IS
CUNNING
WHICH
WE
IN
ENGLAND
CALL
THE
TURNING
OF
THE
CAT
IN
THE
PAN
WHICH
IS
WHEN
THAT
WHICH
MAN
SAYS
TO
ANOTHER
HE
LAYS
IT
AS
IF
ANOTHER
HAD
SAID
IT
TO
HIM
AND
TO
SAY
TRUTH
IT
IS
NOT
EASY
WHEN
SUCH
MATTER
PASSED
BETWEEN
TWO
TO
MAKE
IT
APPEAR
FROM
WHICH
OF
THEM
IT
FIRST
MOVED
AND
BEGAN
IT
IS
WAY
THAT
SOME
MEN
HAVE
TO
GLANCE
AND
DART
AT
OTHERS
BY
JUSTIFYING
THEMSELVES
BY
NEGATIVES
AS
TO
SAY
THIS
DO
NOT
AS
TIGELLINUS
DID
TOWARDS
BURRHUS
SE
NON
DIVERSAS
SPES
SED
INCOLUMITATEM
IMPERATORIS
SIMPLICITER
SPECTARE
SOME
HAVE
IN
READINESS
SO
MANY
TALES
AND
STORIES
AS
THERE
IS
NOTHING
THEY
WOULD
INSINUATE
BUT
THEY
CAN
WRAP
IT
INTO
TALE
WHICH
SERVETH
BOTH
TO
KEEP
THEMSELVES
MORE
IN
GUARD
AND
TO
MAKE
OTHERS
CARRY
IT
WITH
MORE
PLEASURE
IT
IS
GOOD
POINT
OF
CUNNING
FOR
MAN
TO
SHAPE
THE
ANSWER
HE
WOULD
HAVE
IN
HIS
OWN
WORDS
AND
PROPOSITIONS
FOR
IT
MAKES
THE
OTHER
PARTY
STICK
THE
LESS
IT
IS
STRANGE
HOW
LONG
SOME
MEN
WILL
LIE
IN
WAIT
TO
SPEAK
SOMEWHAT
THEY
DESIRE
TO
SAY
AND
HOW
FAR
ABOUT
THEY
WILL
FETCH
AND
HOW
MANY
OTHER
MATTERS
THEY
WILL
BEAT
OVER
TO
COME
NEAR
IT
IT
IS
THING
OF
GREAT
PATIENCE
BUT
YET
OF
MUCH
USE
SUDDEN
BOLD
AND
UNEXPECTED
QUESTION
DOTH
MANY
TIMES
SURPRISE
MAN
AND
LAY
HIM
OPEN
LIKE
TO
HIM
THAT
HAVING
CHANGED
HIS
NAME
AND
WALKING
IN
PAUL
ANOTHER
SUDDENLY
CAME
BEHIND
HIM
AND
CALLED
HIM
BY
HIS
TRUE
NAME
WHEREAT
STRAIGHTWAYS
HE
LOOKED
BACK
BUT
THESE
SMALL
WARES
AND
PETTY
POINTS
OF
CUNNING
ARE
INFINITE
AND
IT
WERE
GOOD
DEED
TO
MAKE
LIST
OF
THEM
FOR
THAT
NOTHING
DOTH
MORE
HURT
IN
STATE
THAN
THAT
CUNNING
MEN
PASS
FOR
WISE
BUT
CERTAINLY
SOME
THERE
ARE
THAT
KNOW
THE
RESORTS
AND
FALLS
OF
BUSINESS
THAT
CANNOT
SINK
INTO
THE
MAIN
OF
IT
LIKE
HOUSE
THAT
HATH
CONVENIENT
STAIRS
AND
ENTRIES
BUT
NEVER
FAIR
ROOM
THEREFORE
YOU
SHALL
SEE
THEM
FIND
OUT
PRETTY
LOOSES
IN
THE
CONCLUSION
BUT
ARE
NO
WAYS
ABLE
TO
EXAMINE
OR
DEBATE
MATTERS
AND
YET
COMMONLY
THEY
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THEIR
INABILITY
AND
WOULD
BE
THOUGHT
WITS
OF
DIRECTION
SOME
BUILD
RATHER
UPON
THE
ABUSING
OF
OTHERS
AND
AS
WE
NOW
SAY
PUTTING
TRICKS
UPON
THEM
THAN
UPON
SOUNDNESS
OF
THEIR
OWN
PROCEEDINGS
BUT
SOLOMON
SAITH
PRUDENS
ADVERTIT
AD
GRESSUS
SUOS
STULTUS
DIVERTIT
AD
DOLOS
OF
WISDOM
FOR
MAN
SELF
AN
ANT
IS
WISE
CREATURE
FOR
ITSELF
BUT
IT
IS
SHREWD
THING
IN
AN
ORCHARD
OR
GARDEN
AND
CERTAINLY
MEN
THAT
ARE
GREAT
LOVERS
OF
THEMSELVES
WASTE
THE
PUBLIC
DIVIDE
WITH
REASON
BETWEEN
SELF
LOVE
AND
SOCIETY
AND
BE
SO
TRUE
TO
THYSELF
AS
THOU
BE
NOT
FALSE
TO
OTHERS
SPECIALLY
TO
THY
KING
AND
COUNTRY
IT
IS
POOR
CENTRE
OF
MAN
ACTIONS
HIMSELF
IT
IS
RIGHT
EARTH
FOR
THAT
ONLY
STANDS
FAST
UPON
HIS
OWN
CENTRE
WHEREAS
ALL
THINGS
THAT
HAVE
AFFINITY
WITH
THE
HEAVENS
MOVE
UPON
THE
CENTRE
OF
ANOTHER
WHICH
THEY
BENEFIT
THE
REFERRING
OF
ALL
TO
MAN
SELF
IS
MORE
TOLERABLE
IN
SOVEREIGN
PRINCE
BECAUSE
THEMSELVES
ARE
NOT
ONLY
THEMSELVES
BUT
THEIR
GOOD
AND
EVIL
IS
AT
THE
PERIL
OF
THE
PUBLIC
FORTUNE
BUT
IT
IS
DESPERATE
EVIL
IN
SERVANT
TO
PRINCE
OR
CITIZEN
IN
REPUBLIC
FOR
WHATSOEVER
AFFAIRS
PASS
SUCH
MAN
HANDS
HE
CROOKETH
THEM
TO
HIS
OWN
ENDS
WHICH
MUST
NEEDS
BE
OFTEN
ECCENTRIC
TO
THE
ENDS
OF
HIS
MASTER
OR
STATE
THEREFORE
LET
PRINCES
OR
STATES
CHOOSE
SUCH
SERVANTS
AS
HAVE
NOT
THIS
MARK
EXCEPT
THEY
MEAN
THEIR
SERVICE
SHOULD
BE
MADE
BUT
THE
ACCESSORY
THAT
WHICH
MAKETH
THE
EFFECT
MORE
PERNICIOUS
IS
THAT
ALL
PROPORTION
IS
LOST
IT
WERE
DISPROPORTION
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
SERVANT
GOOD
TO
BE
PREFERRED
BEFORE
THE
MASTER
BUT
YET
IT
IS
GREATER
EXTREME
WHEN
LITTLE
GOOD
OF
THE
SERVANT
SHALL
CARRY
THINGS
AGAINST
GREAT
GOOD
OF
THE
MASTER
AND
YET
THAT
IS
THE
CASE
OF
BAD
OFFICERS
TREASURERS
AMBASSADORS
GENERALS
AND
OTHER
FALSE
AND
CORRUPT
SERVANTS
WHICH
SET
BIAS
UPON
THEIR
BOWL
OF
THEIR
OWN
PETTY
ENDS
AND
ENVIES
TO
THE
OVERTHROW
OF
THEIR
MASTER
GREAT
AND
IMPORTANT
AFFAIRS
AND
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THE
GOOD
SUCH
SERVANTS
RECEIVE
IS
AFTER
THE
MODEL
OF
THEIR
OWN
FORTUNE
BUT
THE
HURT
THEY
SELL
FOR
THAT
GOOD
IS
AFTER
THE
MODEL
OF
THEIR
MASTER
FORTUNE
AND
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
THE
NATURE
OF
EXTREME
SELF
LOVERS
AS
THEY
WILL
SET
AN
HOUSE
ON
FIRE
AND
IT
WERE
BUT
TO
ROAST
THEIR
EGGS
AND
YET
THESE
MEN
MANY
TIMES
HOLD
CREDIT
WITH
THEIR
MASTERS
BECAUSE
THEIR
STUDY
IS
BUT
TO
PLEASE
THEM
AND
PROFIT
THEMSELVES
AND
FOR
EITHER
RESPECT
THEY
WILL
ABANDON
THE
GOOD
OF
THEIR
AFFAIRS
WISDOM
FOR
MAN
SELF
IS
IN
MANY
BRANCHES
THEREOF
DEPRAVED
THING
IT
IS
THE
WISDOM
OF
RATS
THAT
WILL
BE
SURE
TO
LEAVE
HOUSE
SOMEWHAT
BEFORE
IT
FALL
IT
IS
THE
WISDOM
OF
THE
FOX
THAT
THRUSTS
OUT
THE
BADGER
WHO
DIGGED
AND
MADE
ROOM
FOR
HIM
IT
IS
THE
WISDOM
OF
CROCODILES
THAT
SHED
TEARS
WHEN
THEY
WOULD
DEVOUR
BUT
THAT
WHICH
IS
SPECIALLY
TO
BE
NOTED
IS
THAT
THOSE
WHICH
AS
CICERO
SAYS
OF
POMPEY
ARE
SUI
AMANTES
SINE
RIVALI
ARE
MANY
TIMES
UNFORTUNATE
AND
WHEREAS
THEY
HAVE
ALL
THEIR
TIMES
SACRIFICED
TO
THEMSELVES
THEY
BECOME
IN
THE
END
THEMSELVES
SACRIFICES
TO
THE
INCONSTANCY
OF
FORTUNE
WHOSE
WINGS
THEY
THOUGHT
BY
THEIR
SELF
WISDOM
TO
HAVE
PINIONED
OF
INNOVATIONS
AS
THE
BIRTHS
OF
LIVING
CREATURES
AT
FIRST
ARE
ILL
SHAPEN
SO
ARE
ALL
INNOVATIONS
WHICH
ARE
THE
BIRTHS
OF
TIME
YET
NOTWITHSTANDING
AS
THOSE
THAT
FIRST
BRING
HONOR
INTO
THEIR
FAMILY
ARE
COMMONLY
MORE
WORTHY
THAN
MOST
THAT
SUCCEED
SO
THE
FIRST
PRECEDENT
IF
IT
BE
GOOD
IS
SELDOM
ATTAINED
BY
IMITATION
FOR
ILL
TO
MAN
NATURE
AS
IT
STANDS
PERVERTED
HATH
NATURAL
MOTION
STRONGEST
IN
CONTINUANCE
BUT
GOOD
AS
FORCED
MOTION
STRONGEST
AT
FIRST
SURELY
EVERY
MEDICINE
IS
AN
INNOVATION
AND
HE
THAT
WILL
NOT
APPLY
NEW
REMEDIES
MUST
EXPECT
NEW
EVILS
FOR
TIME
IS
THE
GREATEST
INNOVATOR
AND
IF
TIME
OF
COURSE
ALTER
THINGS
TO
THE
WORSE
AND
WISDOM
AND
COUNSEL
SHALL
NOT
ALTER
THEM
TO
THE
BETTER
WHAT
SHALL
BE
THE
END
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
WHAT
IS
SETTLED
BY
CUSTOM
THOUGH
IT
BE
NOT
GOOD
YET
AT
LEAST
IT
IS
FIT
AND
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
HAVE
LONG
GONE
TOGETHER
ARE
AS
IT
WERE
CONFEDERATE
WITHIN
THEMSELVES
WHEREAS
NEW
THINGS
PIECE
NOT
SO
WELL
BUT
THOUGH
THEY
HELP
BY
THEIR
UTILITY
YET
THEY
TROUBLE
BY
THEIR
INCONFORMITY
BESIDES
THEY
ARE
LIKE
STRANGERS
MORE
ADMIRED
AND
LESS
FAVORED
ALL
THIS
IS
TRUE
IF
TIME
STOOD
STILL
WHICH
CONTRARIWISE
MOVETH
SO
ROUND
THAT
FROWARD
RETENTION
OF
CUSTOM
IS
AS
TURBULENT
THING
AS
AN
INNOVATION
AND
THEY
THAT
REVERENCE
TOO
MUCH
OLD
TIMES
ARE
BUT
SCORN
TO
THE
NEW
IT
WERE
GOOD
THEREFORE
THAT
MEN
IN
THEIR
INNOVATIONS
WOULD
FOLLOW
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
TIME
ITSELF
WHICH
INDEED
INNOVATETH
GREATLY
BUT
QUIETLY
BY
DEGREES
SCARCE
TO
BE
PERCEIVED
FOR
OTHERWISE
WHATSOEVER
IS
NEW
IS
UNLOOKED
FOR
AND
EVER
IT
MENDS
SOME
AND
PAIRS
OTHERS
AND
HE
THAT
IS
HOLPEN
TAKES
IT
FOR
FORTUNE
AND
THANKS
THE
TIME
AND
HE
THAT
IS
HURT
FOR
WRONG
AND
IMPUTETH
IT
TO
THE
AUTHOR
IT
IS
GOOD
ALSO
NOT
TO
TRY
EXPERIMENTS
IN
STATES
EXCEPT
THE
NECESSITY
BE
URGENT
OR
THE
UTILITY
EVIDENT
AND
WELL
TO
BEWARE
THAT
IT
BE
THE
REFORMATION
THAT
DRAWETH
ON
THE
CHANGE
AND
NOT
THE
DESIRE
OF
CHANGE
THAT
PRETENDETH
THE
REFORMATION
AND
LASTLY
THAT
THE
NOVELTY
THOUGH
IT
BE
NOT
REJECTED
YET
BE
HELD
FOR
SUSPECT
AND
AS
THE
SCRIPTURE
SAITH
THAT
WE
MAKE
STAND
UPON
THE
ANCIENT
WAY
AND
THEN
LOOK
ABOUT
US
AND
DISCOVER
WHAT
IS
THE
STRAIGHT
AND
RIGHT
WAY
AND
SO
TO
WALK
IN
IT
OF
DISPATCH
AFFECTED
DISPATCH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
THINGS
TO
BUSINESS
THAT
CAN
BE
IT
IS
LIKE
THAT
WHICH
THE
PHYSICIANS
CALL
PREDIGESTION
OR
HASTY
DIGESTION
WHICH
IS
SURE
TO
FILL
THE
BODY
FULL
OF
CRUDITIES
AND
SECRET
SEEDS
OF
DISEASES
THEREFORE
MEASURE
NOT
DISPATCH
BY
THE
TIMES
OF
SITTING
BUT
BY
THE
ADVANCEMENT
OF
THE
BUSINESS
AND
AS
IN
RACES
IT
IS
NOT
THE
LARGE
STRIDE
OR
HIGH
LIFT
THAT
MAKES
THE
SPEED
SO
IN
BUSINESS
THE
KEEPING
CLOSE
TO
THE
MATTER
AND
NOT
TAKING
OF
IT
TOO
MUCH
AT
ONCE
PROCURETH
DISPATCH
IT
IS
THE
CARE
OF
SOME
ONLY
TO
COME
OFF
SPEEDILY
FOR
THE
TIME
OR
TO
CONTRIVE
SOME
FALSE
PERIODS
OF
BUSINESS
BECAUSE
THEY
MAY
SEEM
MEN
OF
DISPATCH
BUT
IT
IS
ONE
THING
TO
ABBREVIATE
BY
CONTRACTING
ANOTHER
BY
CUTTING
OFF
AND
BUSINESS
SO
HANDLED
AT
SEVERAL
SITTINGS
OR
MEETINGS
GOETH
COMMONLY
BACKWARD
AND
FORWARD
IN
AN
UNSTEADY
MANNER
KNEW
WISE
MAN
THAT
HAD
IT
FOR
BYWORD
WHEN
HE
SAW
MEN
HASTEN
TO
CONCLUSION
STAY
LITTLE
THAT
WE
MAY
MAKE
AN
END
THE
SOONER
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
TRUE
DISPATCH
IS
RICH
THING
FOR
TIME
IS
THE
MEASURE
OF
BUSINESS
AS
MONEY
IS
OF
WARES
AND
BUSINESS
IS
BOUGHT
AT
DEAR
HAND
WHERE
THERE
IS
SMALL
DISPATCH
THE
SPARTANS
AND
SPANIARDS
HAVE
BEEN
NOTED
TO
BE
OF
SMALL
DISPATCH
MI
VENGA
LA
MUERTE
DE
SPAGNA
LET
MY
DEATH
COME
FROM
SPAIN
FOR
THEN
IT
WILL
BE
SURE
TO
BE
LONG
IN
COMING
GIVE
GOOD
HEARING
TO
THOSE
THAT
GIVE
THE
FIRST
INFORMATION
IN
BUSINESS
AND
RATHER
DIRECT
THEM
IN
THE
BEGINNING
THAN
INTERRUPT
THEM
IN
THE
CONTINUANCE
OF
THEIR
SPEECHES
FOR
HE
THAT
IS
PUT
OUT
OF
HIS
OWN
ORDER
WILL
GO
FORWARD
AND
BACKWARD
AND
BE
MORE
TEDIOUS
WHILE
HE
WAITS
UPON
HIS
MEMORY
THAN
HE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
IF
HE
HAD
GONE
ON
IN
HIS
OWN
COURSE
BUT
SOMETIMES
IT
IS
SEEN
THAT
THE
MODERATOR
IS
MORE
TROUBLESOME
THAN
THE
ACTOR
ITERATIONS
ARE
COMMONLY
LOSS
OF
TIME
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
GAIN
OF
TIME
AS
TO
ITERATE
OFTEN
THE
STATE
OF
THE
QUESTION
FOR
IT
CHASETH
AWAY
MANY
FRIVOLOUS
SPEECH
AS
IT
IS
COMING
FORTH
LONG
AND
CURIOUS
SPEECHES
ARE
AS
FIT
FOR
DISPATCH
AS
ROBE
OR
MANTLE
WITH
LONG
TRAIN
IS
FOR
RACE
PREFACES
AND
PASSAGES
AND
EXCUSATIONS
AND
OTHER
SPEECHES
OF
REFERENCE
TO
THE
PERSON
ARE
GREAT
WASTES
OF
TIME
AND
THOUGH
THEY
SEEM
TO
PROCEED
OF
MODESTY
THEY
ARE
BRAVERY
YET
BEWARE
OF
BEING
TOO
MATERIAL
WHEN
THERE
IS
ANY
IMPEDIMENT
OR
OBSTRUCTION
IN
MEN
WILLS
FOR
PRE
OCCUPATION
OF
MIND
EVER
REQUIRETH
PREFACE
OF
SPEECH
LIKE
FOMENTATION
TO
MAKE
THE
UNGUENT
ENTER
ABOVE
ALL
THINGS
ORDER
AND
DISTRIBUTION
AND
SINGLING
OUT
OF
PARTS
IS
THE
LIFE
OF
DISPATCH
SO
AS
THE
DISTRIBUTION
BE
NOT
TOO
SUBTLE
FOR
HE
THAT
DOTH
NOT
DIVIDE
WILL
NEVER
ENTER
WELL
INTO
BUSINESS
AND
HE
THAT
DIVIDETH
TOO
MUCH
WILL
NEVER
COME
OUT
OF
IT
CLEARLY
TO
CHOOSE
TIME
IS
TO
SAVE
TIME
AND
AN
UNSEASONABLE
MOTION
IS
BUT
BEATING
THE
AIR
THERE
BE
THREE
PARTS
OF
BUSINESS
THE
PREPARATION
THE
DEBATE
OR
EXAMINATION
AND
THE
PERFECTION
WHEREOF
IF
YOU
LOOK
FOR
DISPATCH
LET
THE
MIDDLE
ONLY
BE
THE
WORK
OF
MANY
AND
THE
FIRST
AND
LAST
THE
WORK
OF
FEW
THE
PROCEEDING
UPON
SOMEWHAT
CONCEIVED
IN
WRITING
DOTH
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
FACILITATE
DISPATCH
FOR
THOUGH
IT
SHOULD
BE
WHOLLY
REJECTED
YET
THAT
NEGATIVE
IS
MORE
PREGNANT
OF
DIRECTION
THAN
AN
INDEFINITE
AS
ASHES
ARE
MORE
GENERATIVE
THAN
DUST
OF
SEEMING
WISE
IT
HATH
BEEN
AN
OPINION
THAT
THE
FRENCH
ARE
WISER
THAN
THEY
SEEM
AND
THE
SPANIARDS
SEEM
WISER
THAN
THEY
ARE
BUT
HOWSOEVER
IT
BE
BETWEEN
NATIONS
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
SO
BETWEEN
MAN
AND
MAN
FOR
AS
THE
APOSTLE
SAITH
OF
GODLINESS
HAVING
SHOW
OF
GODLINESS
BUT
DENYING
THE
POWER
THEREOF
SO
CERTAINLY
THERE
ARE
IN
POINT
OF
WISDOM
AND
SUFFICIENCY
THAT
DO
NOTHING
OR
LITTLE
VERY
SOLEMNLY
MAGNO
CONATU
NUGAS
IT
IS
RIDICULOUS
THING
AND
FIT
FOR
SATIRE
TO
PERSONS
OF

CERTAINLY
YOU
WERE

TAKE
FOR

MAN
SOMEWHAT
ABSURD
THAN
OVER
FORMAL
OF

IT
HAD
BEEN
HARD
FOR
HIM
THAT
SPAKE
IT
TO
HAVE
PUT
MORE
TRUTH
AND
UNTRUTH
TOGETHER
IN
FEW
WORDS
THAN
IN
THAT
SPEECH
WHATSOEVER
IS
DELIGHTED
IN
SOLITUDE
IS
EITHER
WILD
BEAST
OR
GOD
FOR
IT
IS
MOST
TRUE
THAT
NATURAL
AND
SECRET
HATRED
AND
AVERSATION
TOWARDS
SOCIETY
IN
ANY
MAN
HATH
SOMEWHAT
OF
THE
SAVAGE
BEAST
BUT
IT
IS
MOST
UNTRUE
THAT
IT
SHOULD
HAVE
ANY
CHARACTER
AT
ALL
OF
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
EXCEPT
IT
PROCEED
NOT
OUT
OF
PLEASURE
IN
SOLITUDE
BUT
OUT
OF
LOVE
AND
DESIRE
TO
SEQUESTER
MAN
SELF
FOR
HIGHER
CONVERSATION
SUCH
AS
IS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
BEEN
FALSELY
AND
FEIGNEDLY
IN
SOME
OF
THE
HEATHEN
AS
EPIMENIDES
THE
CANDIAN
NUMA
THE
ROMAN
EMPEDOCLES
THE
SICILIAN
AND
APOLLONIUS
OF
TYANA
AND
TRULY
AND
REALLY
IN
DIVERS
OF
THE
ANCIENT
HERMITS
AND
HOLY
FATHERS
OF
THE
CHURCH
BUT
LITTLE
DO
MEN
PERCEIVE
WHAT
SOLITUDE
IS
AND
HOW
FAR
IT
EXTENDETH
FOR
CROWD
IS
NOT
COMPANY
AND
FACES
ARE
BUT
GALLERY
OF
PICTURES
AND
TALK
BUT
TINKLING
CYMBAL
WHERE
THERE
IS
NO
LOVE
THE
LATIN
ADAGE
MEETETH
WITH
IT
LITTLE
MAGNA
CIVITAS
MAGNA
SOLITUDO
BECAUSE
IN
GREAT
TOWN
FRIENDS
ARE
SCATTERED
SO
THAT
THERE
IS
NOT
THAT
FELLOWSHIP
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
WHICH
IS
IN
LESS
NEIGHBORHOODS
BUT
WE
MAY
GO
FURTHER
AND
AFFIRM
MOST
TRULY
THAT
IT
IS
MERE
AND
MISERABLE
SOLITUDE
TO
WANT
TRUE
FRIENDS
WITHOUT
WHICH
THE
WORLD
IS
BUT
WILDERNESS
AND
EVEN
IN
THIS
SENSE
ALSO
OF
SOLITUDE
WHOSOEVER
IN
THE
FRAME
OF
HIS
NATURE
AND
AFFECTIONS
IS
UNFIT
FOR
FRIENDSHIP
HE
TAKETH
IT
OF
THE
BEAST
AND
NOT
FROM
HUMANITY
PRINCIPAL
FRUIT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
IS
THE
EASE
AND
DISCHARGE
OF
THE
FULNESS
AND
SWELLINGS
OF
THE
HEART
WHICH
PASSIONS
OF
ALL
KINDS
DO
CAUSE
AND
INDUCE
WE
KNOW
DISEASES
OF
STOPPINGS
AND
SUFFOCATIONS
ARE
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
IN
THE
BODY
AND
IT
IS
NOT
MUCH
OTHERWISE
IN
THE
MIND
YOU
MAY
TAKE
SARZA
TO
OPEN
THE
LIVER
STEEL
TO
OPEN
THE
SPLEEN
FLOWERS
OF
SULPHUR
FOR
THE
LUNGS
CASTOREUM
FOR
THE
BRAIN
BUT
NO
RECEIPT
OPENETH
THE
HEART
BUT
TRUE
FRIEND
TO
WHOM
YOU
MAY
IMPART
GRIEFS
JOYS
FEARS
HOPES
SUSPICIONS
COUNSELS
AND
WHATSOEVER
LIETH
UPON
THE
HEART
TO
OPPRESS
IT
IN
KIND
OF
CIVIL
SHRIFT
OR
CONFESSION
IT
IS
STRANGE
THING
TO
OBSERVE
HOW
HIGH
RATE
GREAT
KINGS
AND
MONARCHS
DO
SET
UPON
THIS
FRUIT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
WHEREOF
WE
SPEAK
SO
GREAT
AS
THEY
PURCHASE
IT
MANY
TIMES
AT
THE
HAZARD
OF
THEIR
OWN
SAFETY
AND
GREATNESS
FOR
PRINCES
IN
REGARD
OF
THE
DISTANCE
OF
THEIR
FORTUNE
FROM
THAT
OF
THEIR
SUBJECTS
AND
SERVANTS
CANNOT
GATHER
THIS
FRUIT
EXCEPT
TO
MAKE
THEMSELVES
CAPABLE
THEREOF
THEY
RAISE
SOME
PERSONS
TO
BE
AS
IT
WERE
COMPANIONS
AND
ALMOST
EQUALS
TO
THEMSELVES
WHICH
MANY
TIMES
SORTETH
TO
INCONVENIENCE
THE
MODERN
LANGUAGES
GIVE
UNTO
SUCH
PERSONS
THE
NAME
OF
FAVORITES
OR
PRIVADOES
AS
IF
IT
WERE
MATTER
OF
GRACE
OR
CONVERSATION
BUT
THE
ROMAN
NAME
ATTAINETH
THE
TRUE
USE
AND
CAUSE
THEREOF
NAMING
THEM
PARTICIPES
CURARUM
FOR
IT
IS
THAT
WHICH
TIETH
THE
KNOT
AND
WE
SEE
PLAINLY
THAT
THIS
HATH
BEEN
DONE
NOT
BY
WEAK
AND
PASSIONATE
PRINCES
ONLY
BUT
BY
THE
WISEST
AND
MOST
POLITIC
THAT
EVER
REIGNED
WHO
HAVE
OFTENTIMES
JOINED
TO
THEMSELVES
SOME
OF
THEIR
SERVANTS
WHOM
BOTH
THEMSELVES
HAVE
CALLED
FRIENDS
AND
ALLOWED
OTHER
LIKEWISE
TO
CALL
THEM
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER
USING
THE
WORD
WHICH
IS
RECEIVED
BETWEEN
PRIVATE
MEN
SYLLA
WHEN
HE
COMMANDED
ROME
RAISED
POMPEY
AFTER
SURNAMED
THE
GREAT
TO
THAT
HEIGHT
THAT
POMPEY
VAUNTED
HIMSELF
FOR
SYLLA
OVERMATCH
FOR
WHEN
HE
HAD
CARRIED
THE
CONSULSHIP
FOR
FRIEND
OF
HIS
AGAINST
THE
PURSUIT
OF
SYLLA
AND
THAT
SYLLA
DID
LITTLE
RESENT
THEREAT
AND
BEGAN
TO
SPEAK
GREAT
POMPEY
TURNED
UPON
HIM
AGAIN
AND
IN
EFFECT
BADE
HIM
BE
QUIET
FOR
THAT
MORE
MEN
ADORED
THE
SUN
RISING
THAN
THE
SUN
SETTING
WITH
JULIUS
CAESAR
DECIMUS
BRUTUS
HAD
OBTAINED
THAT
INTEREST
AS
HE
SET
HIM
DOWN
IN
HIS
TESTAMENT
FOR
HEIR
IN
REMAINDER
AFTER
HIS
NEPHEW
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
MAN
THAT
HAD
POWER
WITH
HIM
TO
DRAW
HIM
FORTH
TO
HIS
DEATH
FOR
WHEN
CAESAR
WOULD
HAVE
DISCHARGED
THE
SENATE
IN
REGARD
OF
SOME
ILL
PRESAGES
AND
SPECIALLY
DREAM
OF
CALPURNIA
THIS
MAN
LIFTED
HIM
GENTLY
BY
THE
ARM
OUT
OF
HIS
CHAIR
TELLING
HIM
HE
HOPED
HE
WOULD
NOT
DISMISS
THE
SENATE
TILL
HIS
WIFE
HAD
DREAMT
BETTER
DREAM
AND
IT
SEEMETH
HIS
FAVOR
WAS
SO
GREAT
AS
ANTONIUS
IN
LETTER
WHICH
IS
RECITED
VERBATIM
IN
ONE
OF
CICERO
PHILIPPICS
CALLETH
HIM
VENEFICA
WITCH
AS
IF
HE
HAD
ENCHANTED
CAESAR
AUGUSTUS
RAISED
AGRIPPA
THOUGH
OF
MEAN
BIRTH
TO
THAT
HEIGHT
AS
WHEN
HE
CONSULTED
WITH
MAECENAS
ABOUT
THE
MARRIAGE
OF
HIS
DAUGHTER
JULIA
MAECENAS
TOOK
THE
LIBERTY
TO
TELL
HIM
THAT
HE
MUST
EITHER
MARRY
HIS
DAUGHTER
TO
AGRIPPA
OR
TAKE
AWAY
HIS
LIFE
THERE
WAS
NO
THIRD
WAY
HE
HAD
MADE
HIM
SO
GREAT
WITH
TIBERIUS
CAESAR
SEJANUS
HAD
ASCENDED
TO
THAT
HEIGHT
AS
THEY
TWO
WERE
TERMED
AND
RECKONED
AS
PAIR
OF
FRIENDS
TIBERIUS
IN
LETTER
TO
HIM
SAITH
HAEC
PRO
AMICITIA
NOSTRA
NON
OCCULTAVI
AND
THE
WHOLE
SENATE
DEDICATED
AN
ALTAR
TO
FRIENDSHIP
AS
TO
GODDESS
IN
RESPECT
OF
THE
GREAT
DEARNESS
OF
FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN
THEM
TWO
THE
LIKE
OR
MORE
WAS
BETWEEN
SEPTIMIUS
SEVERUS
AND
PLAUTIANUS
FOR
HE
FORCED
HIS
ELDEST
SON
TO
MARRY
THE
DAUGHTER
OF
PLAUTIANUS
AND
WOULD
OFTEN
MAINTAIN
PLAUTIANUS
IN
DOING
AFFRONTS
TO
HIS
SON
AND
DID
WRITE
ALSO
IN
LETTER
TO
THE
SENATE
BY
THESE
WORDS
LOVE
THE
MAN
SO
WELL
AS
WISH
HE
MAY
OVER
LIVE
ME
NOW
IF
THESE
PRINCES
HAD
BEEN
AS
TRAJAN
OR
MARCUS
AURELIUS
MAN
MIGHT
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
HAD
PROCEEDED
OF
AN
ABUNDANT
GOODNESS
OF
NATURE
BUT
BEING
MEN
SO
WISE
OF
SUCH
STRENGTH
AND
SEVERITY
OF
MIND
AND
SO
EXTREME
LOVERS
OF
THEMSELVES
AS
ALL
THESE
WERE
IT
PROVETH
MOST
PLAINLY
THAT
THEY
FOUND
THEIR
OWN
FELICITY
THOUGH
AS
GREAT
AS
EVER
HAPPENED
TO
MORTAL
MEN
BUT
AS
AN
HALF
PIECE
EXCEPT
THEY
MOUGHT
HAVE
FRIEND
TO
MAKE
IT
ENTIRE
AND
YET
WHICH
IS
MORE
THEY
WERE
PRINCES
THAT
HAD
WIVES
SONS
NEPHEWS
AND
YET
ALL
THESE
COULD
NOT
SUPPLY
THE
COMFORT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
IT
IS
NOT
TO
BE
FORGOTTEN
WHAT
COMINEUS
OBSERVETH
OF
HIS
FIRST
MASTER
DUKE
CHARLES
THE
HARDY
NAMELY
THAT
HE
WOULD
COMMUNICATE
HIS
SECRETS
WITH
NONE
AND
LEAST
OF
ALL
THOSE
SECRETS
WHICH
TROUBLED
HIM
MOST
WHEREUPON
HE
GOETH
ON
AND
SAITH
THAT
TOWARDS
HIS
LATTER
TIME
THAT
CLOSENESS
DID
IMPAIR
AND
LITTLE
PERISH
HIS
UNDERSTANDING
SURELY
COMINEUS
MOUGHT
HAVE
MADE
THE
SAME
JUDGMENT
ALSO
IF
IT
HAD
PLEASED
HIM
OF
HIS
SECOND
MASTER
LEWIS
THE
ELEVENTH
WHOSE
CLOSENESS
WAS
INDEED
HIS
TORMENTOR
THE
PARABLE
OF
PYTHAGORAS
IS
DARK
BUT
TRUE
COR
NE
EDITO
EAT
NOT
THE
HEART
CERTAINLY
IF
MAN
WOULD
GIVE
IT
HARD
PHRASE
THOSE
THAT
WANT
FRIENDS
TO
OPEN
THEMSELVES
UNTO
ARE
CANNIBALS
OF
THEIR
OWN
HEARTS
BUT
ONE
THING
IS
MOST
ADMIRABLE
WHEREWITH
WILL
CONCLUDE
THIS
FIRST
FRUIT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
WHICH
IS
THAT
THIS
COMMUNICATING
OF
MAN
SELF
TO
HIS
FRIEND
WORKS
TWO
CONTRARY
EFFECTS
FOR
IT
REDOUBLETH
JOYS
AND
CUTTETH
GRIEFS
IN
HALVES
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
MAN
THAT
IMPARTETH
HIS
JOYS
TO
HIS
FRIEND
BUT
HE
JOYETH
THE
MORE
AND
NO
MAN
THAT
IMPARTETH
HIS
GRIEFS
TO
HIS
FRIEND
BUT
HE
GRIEVETH
THE
LESS
SO
THAT
IT
IS
IN
TRUTH
OF
OPERATION
UPON
MAN
MIND
OF
LIKE
VIRTUE
AS
THE
ALCHEMISTS
USE
TO
ATTRIBUTE
TO
THEIR
STONE
FOR
MAN
BODY
THAT
IT
WORKETH
ALL
CONTRARY
EFFECTS
BUT
STILL
TO
THE
GOOD
AND
BENEFIT
OF
NATURE
BUT
YET
WITHOUT
PRAYING
IN
AID
OF
ALCHEMISTS
THERE
IS
MANIFEST
IMAGE
OF
THIS
IN
THE
ORDINARY
COURSE
OF
NATURE
FOR
IN
BODIES
UNION
STRENGTHENETH
AND
CHERISHETH
ANY
NATURAL
ACTION
AND
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
WEAKENETH
AND
DULLETH
ANY
VIOLENT
IMPRESSION
AND
EVEN
SO
IT
IS
OF
MINDS
THE
SECOND
FRUIT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
IS
HEALTHFUL
AND
SOVEREIGN
FOR
THE
UNDERSTANDING
AS
THE
FIRST
IS
FOR
THE
AFFECTIONS
FOR
FRIENDSHIP
MAKETH
INDEED
FAIR
DAY
IN
THE
AFFECTIONS
FROM
STORM
AND
TEMPESTS
BUT
IT
MAKETH
DAYLIGHT
IN
THE
UNDERSTANDING
OUT
OF
DARKNESS
AND
CONFUSION
OF
THOUGHTS
NEITHER
IS
THIS
TO
BE
UNDERSTOOD
ONLY
OF
FAITHFUL
COUNSEL
WHICH
MAN
RECEIVETH
FROM
HIS
FRIEND
BUT
BEFORE
YOU
COME
TO
THAT
CERTAIN
IT
IS
THAT
WHOSOEVER
HATH
HIS
MIND
FRAUGHT
WITH
MANY
THOUGHTS
HIS
WITS
AND
UNDERSTANDING
DO
CLARIFY
AND
BREAK
UP
IN
THE
COMMUNICATING
AND
DISCOURSING
WITH
ANOTHER
HE
TOSSETH
HIS
THOUGHTS
MORE
EASILY
HE
MARSHALLETH
THEM
MORE
ORDERLY
HE
SEETH
HOW
THEY
LOOK
WHEN
THEY
ARE
TURNED
INTO
WORDS
FINALLY
HE
WAXETH
WISER
THAN
HIMSELF
AND
THAT
MORE
BY
AN
HOUR
DISCOURSE
THAN
BY
DAY
MEDITATION
IT
WAS
WELL
SAID
BY
THEMISTOCLES
TO
THE
KING
OF
PERSIA
THAT
SPEECH
WAS
LIKE
CLOTH
OF
ARRAS
OPENED
AND
PUT
ABROAD
WHEREBY
THE
IMAGERY
DOTH
APPEAR
IN
FIGURE
WHEREAS
IN
THOUGHTS
THEY
LIE
BUT
AS
IN
PACKS
NEITHER
IS
THIS
SECOND
FRUIT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
IN
OPENING
THE
UNDERSTANDING
RESTRAINED
ONLY
TO
SUCH
FRIENDS
AS
ARE
ABLE
TO
GIVE
MAN
COUNSEL
THEY
INDEED
ARE
BEST
BUT
EVEN
WITHOUT
THAT
MAN
LEARNETH
OF
HIMSELF
AND
BRINGETH
HIS
OWN
THOUGHTS
TO
LIGHT
AND
WHETTETH
HIS
WITS
AS
AGAINST
STONE
WHICH
ITSELF
CUTS
NOT
IN
WORD
MAN
WERE
BETTER
RELATE
HIMSELF
TO
STATUA
OR
PICTURE
THAN
TO
SUFFER
HIS
THOUGHTS
TO
PASS
IN
SMOTHER
ADD
NOW
TO
MAKE
THIS
SECOND
FRUIT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
COMPLETE
THAT
OTHER
POINT
WHICH
LIETH
MORE
OPEN
AND
FALLETH
WITHIN
VULGAR
OBSERVATION
WHICH
IS
FAITHFUL
COUNSEL
FROM
FRIEND
HERACLITUS
SAITH
WELL
IN
ONE
OF
HIS
ENIGMAS
DRY
LIGHT
IS
EVER
THE
BEST
AND
CERTAIN
IT
IS
THAT
THE
LIGHT
THAT
MAN
RECEIVETH
BY
COUNSEL
FROM
ANOTHER
IS
DRIER
AND
PURER
THAN
THAT
WHICH
COMETH
FROM
HIS
OWN
UNDERSTANDING
AND
JUDGMENT
WHICH
IS
EVER
INFUSED
AND
DRENCHED
IN
HIS
AFFECTIONS
AND
CUSTOMS
SO
AS
THERE
IS
AS
MUCH
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
COUNSEL
THAT
FRIEND
GIVETH
AND
THAT
MAN
GIVETH
HIMSELF
AS
THERE
IS
BETWEEN
THE
COUNSEL
OF
FRIEND
AND
OF
FLATTERER
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
FLATTERER
AS
IS
MAN
SELF
AND
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
REMEDY
AGAINST
FLATTERY
OF
MAN
SELF
AS
THE
LIBERTY
OF
FRIEND
COUNSEL
IS
OF
TWO
SORTS
THE
ONE
CONCERNING
MANNERS
THE
OTHER
CONCERNING
BUSINESS
FOR
THE
FIRST
THE
BEST
PRESERVATIVE
TO
KEEP
THE
MIND
IN
HEALTH
IS
THE
FAITHFUL
ADMONITION
OF
FRIEND
THE
CALLING
OF
MAN
SELF
TO
STRICT
ACCOUNT
IS
MEDICINE
SOMETIME
TOO
PIERCING
AND
CORROSIVE
READING
GOOD
BOOKS
OF
MORALITY
IS
LITTLE
FLAT
AND
DEAD
OBSERVING
OUR
FAULTS
IN
OTHERS
IS
SOMETIMES
IMPROPER
FOR
OUR
CASE
BUT
THE
BEST
RECEIPT
BEST
SAY
TO
WORK
AND
BEST
TO
TAKE
IS
THE
ADMONITION
OF
FRIEND
IT
IS
STRANGE
THING
TO
BEHOLD
WHAT
GROSS
ERRORS
AND
EXTREME
ABSURDITIES
MANY
ESPECIALLY
OF
THE
GREATER
SORT
DO
COMMIT
FOR
WANT
OF
FRIEND
TO
TELL
THEM
OF
THEM
TO
THE
GREAT
DAMAGE
BOTH
OF
THEIR
FAME
AND
FORTUNE
FOR
AS
ST
JAMES
SAITH
THEY
ARE
AS
MEN
THAT
LOOK
SOMETIMES
INTO
GLASS
AND
PRESENTLY
FORGET
THEIR
OWN
SHAPE
AND
FAVOR
AS
FOR
BUSINESS
MAN
MAY
THINK
IF
HE
WIN
THAT
TWO
EYES
SEE
NO
MORE
THAN
ONE
OR
THAT
GAMESTER
SEETH
ALWAYS
MORE
THAN
LOOKER
ON
OR
THAT
MAN
IN
ANGER
IS
AS
WISE
AS
HE
THAT
HATH
SAID
OVER
THE
FOUR
AND
TWENTY
LETTERS
OR
THAT
MUSKET
MAY
BE
SHOT
OFF
AS
WELL
UPON
THE
ARM
AS
UPON
REST
AND
SUCH
OTHER
FOND
AND
HIGH
IMAGINATIONS
TO
THINK
HIMSELF
ALL
IN
ALL
BUT
WHEN
ALL
IS
DONE
THE
HELP
OF
GOOD
COUNSEL
IS
THAT
WHICH
SETTETH
BUSINESS
STRAIGHT
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
THINK
THAT
HE
WILL
TAKE
COUNSEL
BUT
IT
SHALL
BE
BY
PIECES
ASKING
COUNSEL
IN
ONE
BUSINESS
OF
ONE
MAN
AND
IN
ANOTHER
BUSINESS
OF
ANOTHER
MAN
IT
IS
WELL
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
BETTER
PERHAPS
THAN
IF
HE
ASKED
NONE
AT
ALL
BUT
HE
RUNNETH
TWO
DANGERS
ONE
THAT
HE
SHALL
NOT
BE
FAITHFULLY
COUNSELLED
FOR
IT
IS
RARE
THING
EXCEPT
IT
BE
FROM
PERFECT
AND
ENTIRE
FRIEND
TO
HAVE
COUNSEL
GIVEN
BUT
SUCH
AS
SHALL
BE
BOWED
AND
CROOKED
TO
SOME
ENDS
WHICH
HE
HATH
THAT
GIVETH
IT
THE
OTHER
THAT
HE
SHALL
HAVE
COUNSEL
GIVEN
HURTFUL
AND
UNSAFE
THOUGH
WITH
GOOD
MEANING
AND
MIXED
PARTLY
OF
MISCHIEF
AND
PARTLY
OF
REMEDY
EVEN
AS
IF
YOU
WOULD
CALL
PHYSICIAN
THAT
IS
THOUGHT
GOOD
FOR
THE
CURE
OF
THE
DISEASE
YOU
COMPLAIN
OF
BUT
IS
UNACQUAINTED
WITH
YOUR
BODY
AND
THEREFORE
MAY
PUT
YOU
IN
WAY
FOR
PRESENT
CURE
BUT
OVERTHROWETH
YOUR
HEALTH
IN
SOME
OTHER
KIND
AND
SO
CURE
THE
DISEASE
AND
KILL
THE
PATIENT
BUT
FRIEND
THAT
IS
WHOLLY
ACQUAINTED
WITH
MAN
ESTATE
WILL
BEWARE
BY
FURTHERING
ANY
PRESENT
BUSINESS
HOW
HE
DASHETH
UPON
OTHER
INCONVENIENCE
AND
THEREFORE
REST
NOT
UPON
SCATTERED
COUNSELS
THEY
WILL
RATHER
DISTRACT
AND
MISLEAD
THAN
SETTLE
AND
DIRECT
AFTER
THESE
TWO
NOBLE
FRUITS
OF
FRIENDSHIP
PEACE
IN
THE
AFFECTIONS
AND
SUPPORT
OF
THE
JUDGMENT
FOLLOWETH
THE
LAST
FRUIT
WHICH
IS
LIKE
THE
POMEGRANATE
FULL
OF
MANY
KERNELS
MEAN
AID
AND
BEARING
PART
IN
ALL
ACTIONS
AND
OCCASIONS
HERE
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
REPRESENT
TO
LIFE
THE
MANIFOLD
USE
OF
FRIENDSHIP
IS
TO
CAST
AND
SEE
HOW
MANY
THINGS
THERE
ARE
WHICH
MAN
CANNOT
DO
HIMSELF
AND
THEN
IT
WILL
APPEAR
THAT
IT
WAS
SPARING
SPEECH
OF
THE
ANCIENTS
TO
SAY
THAT
FRIEND
IS
ANOTHER
HIMSELF
FOR
THAT
FRIEND
IS
FAR
MORE
THAN
HIMSELF
MEN
HAVE
THEIR
TIME
AND
DIE
MANY
TIMES
IN
DESIRE
OF
SOME
THINGS
WHICH
THEY
PRINCIPALLY
TAKE
TO
HEART
THE
BESTOWING
OF
CHILD
THE
FINISHING
OF
WORK
OR
THE
LIKE
IF
MAN
HAVE
TRUE
FRIEND
HE
MAY
REST
ALMOST
SECURE
THAT
THE
CARE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
WILL
CONTINUE
AFTER
HIM
SO
THAT
MAN
HATH
AS
IT
WERE
TWO
LIVES
IN
HIS
DESIRES
MAN
HATH
BODY
AND
THAT
BODY
IS
CONFINED
TO
PLACE
BUT
WHERE
FRIENDSHIP
IS
ALL
OFFICES
OF
LIFE
ARE
AS
IT
WERE
GRANTED
TO
HIM
AND
HIS
DEPUTY
FOR
HE
MAY
EXERCISE
THEM
BY
HIS
FRIEND
HOW
MANY
THINGS
ARE
THERE
WHICH
MAN
CANNOT
WITH
ANY
FACE
OR
COMELINESS
SAY
OR
DO
HIMSELF
MAN
CAN
SCARCE
ALLEGE
HIS
OWN
MERITS
WITH
MODESTY
MUCH
LESS
EXTOL
THEM
MAN
CANNOT
SOMETIMES
BROOK
TO
SUPPLICATE
OR
BEG
AND
NUMBER
OF
THE
LIKE
BUT
ALL
THESE
THINGS
ARE
GRACEFUL
IN
FRIEND
MOUTH
WHICH
ARE
BLUSHING
IN
MAN
OWN
SO
AGAIN
MAN
PERSON
HATH
MANY
PROPER
RELATIONS
WHICH
HE
CANNOT
PUT
OFF
MAN
CANNOT
SPEAK
TO
HIS
SON
BUT
AS
FATHER
TO
HIS
WIFE
BUT
AS
HUSBAND
TO
HIS
ENEMY
BUT
UPON
TERMS
WHEREAS
FRIEND
MAY
SPEAK
AS
THE
CASE
REQUIRES
AND
NOT
AS
IT
SORTETH
WITH
THE
PERSON
BUT
TO
ENUMERATE
THESE
THINGS
WERE
ENDLESS
HAVE
GIVEN
THE
RULE
WHERE
MAN
CANNOT
FITLY
PLAY
HIS
OWN
PART
IF
HE
HAVE
NOT
FRIEND
HE
MAY
QUIT
THE
STAGE
OF
EXPENSE
RICHES
ARE
FOR
SPENDING
AND
SPENDING
FOR
HONOR
AND
GOOD
ACTIONS
THEREFORE
EXTRAORDINARY
EXPENSE
MUST
BE
LIMITED
BY
THE
WORTH
OF
THE
OCCASION
FOR
VOLUNTARY
UNDOING
MAY
BE
AS
WELL
FOR
MAN
COUNTRY
AS
FOR
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
BUT
ORDINARY
EXPENSE
OUGHT
TO
BE
LIMITED
BY
MAN
ESTATE
AND
GOVERNED
WITH
SUCH
REGARD
AS
IT
BE
WITHIN
HIS
COMPASS
AND
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
DECEIT
AND
ABUSE
OF
SERVANTS
AND
ORDERED
TO
THE
BEST
SHOW
THAT
THE
BILLS
MAY
BE
LESS
THAN
THE
ESTIMATION
ABROAD
CERTAINLY
IF
MAN
WILL
KEEP
BUT
OF
EVEN
HAND
HIS
ORDINARY
EXPENSES
OUGHT
TO
BE
BUT
TO
THE
HALF
OF
HIS
RECEIPTS
AND
IF
HE
THINK
TO
WAX
RICH
BUT
TO
THE
THIRD
PART
IT
IS
NO
BASENESS
FOR
THE
GREATEST
TO
DESCEND
AND
LOOK
INTO
THEIR
OWN
ESTATE
SOME
FORBEAR
IT
NOT
UPON
NEGLIGENCE
ALONE
BUT
DOUBTING
TO
BRING
THEMSELVES
INTO
MELANCHOLY
IN
RESPECT
THEY
SHALL
FIND
IT
BROKEN
BUT
WOUNDS
CANNOT
BE
CURED
WITHOUT
SEARCHING
HE
THAT
CANNOT
LOOK
INTO
HIS
OWN
ESTATE
AT
ALL
HAD
NEED
BOTH
CHOOSE
WELL
THOSE
WHOM
HE
EMPLOYETH
AND
CHANGE
THEM
OFTEN
FOR
NEW
ARE
MORE
TIMOROUS
AND
LESS
SUBTLE
HE
THAT
CAN
LOOK
INTO
HIS

BUT
SELDOM
IT
BEHOOVETH
HIM
TO
TURN
ALL
TO
CERTAINTIES
MAN
HAD
NEED
IF
HE
BE
PLENTIFUL
IN
SOME
KIND
OF
EXPENSE
TO
BE
AS

IN
SOME

AS
IF

TO

IF

TO
BE

IN
THE
STABLE
AND
THE

FOR
HE
THAT
IS
PLENTIFUL
IN
EXPENSES
OF

WILL
HARDLY
BE
PRESERVED
FROM

IN

OF

HE
MAY
AS

HURT
HIMSELF
IN
BEING
TOO
SUDDEN
AS
IN
LETTING
IT
RUN
ON
TOO
LONG
FOR
HASTY
SELLING
IS
COMMONLY
AS
DISADVANTAGEABLE
AS
INTEREST
BESIDES
HE
THAT
CLEARS
AT

WILL
RELAPSE
FOR
FINDING
HIMSELF
OUT
OF
STRAITS
HE
WILL
REVERT
TO
HIS

BUT
HE
THAT
CLEARETH
BY
DEGREES
INDUCETH
HABIT
OF
FRUGALITY
AND

AS
WELL
UPON
HIS
MIND
AS
UPON
HIS

CERTAINLY
WHO
HATH
STATE
TO

MAY
NOT
DESPISE

AND
COMMONLY
IT
IS
LESS
DISHONORABLE
TO
ABRIDGE
PETTY

THAN
TO
STOOP
TO
PETTY
GETTINGS
MAN
OUGHT
WARILY
TO
BEGIN
CHARGES
WHICH
ONCE

BUT
IN
MATTERS
THAT
RETURN
NOT
HE
MAY
BE
MORE
MAGNIFICENT
OF
THE
TRUE
GREATNESS
OF

AND

THE
SPEECH
OF
THEMISTOCLES
THE
ATHENIAN
WHICH
WAS
HAUGHTY
AND
ARROGANT
IN

SO
MUCH
TO

HAD
BEEN
GRAVE

AT

HE

THESE
WORDS

WITH

MAY

TWO
DIFFERING
ABILITIES
IN
THOSE
THAT

IN

OF

FOR
IF
TRUE

THERE
MAY

RARELY
THOSE
WHICH
CAN

GREAT

CANNOT
FIDDLE
AS
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
THERE
WILL
BE
FOUND
GREAT
MANY
THAT
CAN

VERY
CUNNINGLY
BUT

ARE
SO
FAR
FROM
BEING
ABLE
TO

STATE
GREAT
AS
THEIR
GIFT
LIETH
THE
OTHER
WAY
TO
BRING
GREAT
AND
FLOURISHING

TO

AND
CERTAINLY
WHOSE
DEGENERATE
ARTS
AND
SHIFTS
WHEREBY
MANY
COUNSELLORS
AND
GOVERNORS
GAIN
BOTH
FAVOR
WITH
THEIR
MASTERS
AND
ESTIMATION
WITH
THE

DESERVE
NO
BETTER

THAN
FIDDLING
BEING
THINGS
RATHER
PLEASING
FOR

GRACEFUL
TO
THEMSELVES
ONLY
THAN
TENDING
TO
THE
WEAL
AND
ADVANCEMENT
OF
THE
STATE
WHICH
THEY
SERVE
THERE
ARE
ALSO
NO

COUNSELLORS

GOVERNORS
WHICH
MAY
BE
HELD
SUFFICIENT
NEGOTIIS
PARES
ABLE
TO
MANAGE
AFFAIRS
AND
TO
KEEP
THEM
FROM
PRECIPICES
AND
MANIFEST
INCONVENIENCES
WHICH
NEVERTHELESS
ARE
FAR
FROM
THE
ABILITY
TO
RAISE
AND
AMPLIFY
AN
ESTATE
IN
POWER
MEANS
AND
FORTUNE
BUT
BE
THE
WORKMEN
WHAT
THEY
MAY
BE
LET
US
SPEAK
OF
THE
WORK
THAT
IS
THE
TRUE
GREATNESS
OF
KINGDOMS
AND
ESTATES
AND
THE
MEANS
THEREOF
AN
ARGUMENT
FIT
FOR
GREAT
AND
MIGHTY
PRINCES
TO
HAVE
IN
THEIR

TO
THE
END
THAT
NEITHER
BY
OVER
MEASURING
THEIR
FORCES
THEY
LEESE
THEMSELVES
IN

NOR
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
BY
UNDERVALUING
THEM
THEY
DESCEND
TO
FEARFUL
AND
PUSILLANIMOUS
COUNSELS
THE
GREATNESS
OF
AN

IN
BULK
AND
TERRITORY
DOTH
FALL
UNDER
MEASURE
AND
THE
GREATNESS
OF
FINANCES
AND
REVENUE
DOTH
FALL
UNDER
COMPUTATION
THE
POPULATION
MAY
APPEAR
BY
MUSTERS
AND
THE
NUMBER
AND
GREATNESS
OF
CITIES
AND

BY
CARDS
AND

BUT
YET
THERE
IS
NOT
ANY
THING
AMONGST
CIVIL
AFFAIRS
MORE
SUBJECT
TO
ERROR
THAN
THE
RIGHT
VALUATION
AND
TRUE
JUDGMENT
CONCERNING
THE
POWER
AND
FORCES
OF
AN
ESTATE
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
COMPARED
NOT
TO
ANY
GREAT
KERNEL
OR
NUT
BUT
TO
GRAIN
OF
MUSTARD
SEED
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
LEAST
GRAINS
BUT
HATH
IN
IT
PROPERTY
AND
SPIRIT
HASTILY
TO
GET
UP
AND
SPREAD
SO
ARE
THERE
STATES
GREAT
IN
TERRITORY
AND
YET
NOT
APT
TO
ENLARGE
OR
COMMAND
AND
SOME
THAT
HAVE
BUT
SMALL
DIMENSION
OF

AND
YET
APT
TO
BE
THE
FOUNDATIONS
OF
GREAT

WALLED

STORED
ARSENALS
AND

GOODLY
RACES
OF

CHARIOTS
OF

AND
THE
LIKE
ALL
THIS
IS
BUT
SHEEP
IN

SKIN
EXCEPT
THE
BREED
AND
DISPOSITION
OF
THE
PEOPLE
BE
STOUT
AND
WARLIKE
NAY
NUMBER
ITSELF
IN

IMPORTETH
NOT
MUCH
WHERE
THE

IS
OF
WEAK
COURAGE
FOR
AS
VIRGIL
SAITH
IT
NEVER
TROUBLES
WOLF
HOW
MANY
THE
SHEEP
BE
THE
ARMY
OF
THE
PERSIANS
IN
THE
PLAINS
OF
ARBELA
WAS
SUCH
VAST
SEA
OF
PEOPLE
AS
IT
DID
SOMEWHAT
ASTONISH
THE
COMMANDERS
IN
ALEXANDER
ARMY
WHO
CAME
TO
HIM
THEREFORE
AND
WISHED
HIM
TO
SET
UPON
THEM
BY
NIGHT
AND
HE
ANSWERED
HE
WOULD
NOT
PILFER
THE
VICTORY
AND
THE
DEFEAT
WAS
EASY
WHEN
TIGRANES
THE
ARMENIAN
BEING
ENCAMPED
UPON
HILL
WITH
FOUR
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
MEN
DISCOVERED
THE
ARMY
OF
THE
ROMANS
BEING
NOT
ABOVE
FOURTEEN
THOUSAND
MARCHING
TOWARDS
HIM
HE
MADE
HIMSELF
MERRY
WITH
IT
AND
SAID
YONDER
MEN
ARE
TOO
MANY
FOR
AN
EMBASSAGE
AND
TOO
FEW
FOR
FIGHT
BUT
BEFORE
THE
SUN
SET
HE
FOUND
THEM
ENOW
TO
GIVE
HIM
THE
CHASE
WITH
INFINITE
SLAUGHTER
MANY
ARE
THE
EXAMPLES
OF
THE
GREAT
ODDS
BETWEEN
NUMBER
AND
COURAGE
SO
THAT
MAN
MAY
TRULY
MAKE
JUDGMENT
THAT
THE
PRINCIPAL
POINT
OF
GREATNESS
IN
ANY
STATE
IS
TO
HAVE
RACE
OF
MILITARY
MEN
NEITHER
IS
MONEY
THE
SINEWS
OF
WAR
AS
IT
IS
TRIVIALLY
SAID
WHERE
THE
SINEWS
OF
MEN
ARMS
IN
BASE
AND
EFFEMINATE
PEOPLE
ARE
FAILING
FOR
SOLON
SAID
WELL
TO
CROESUS
WHEN
IN
OSTENTATION
HE
SHOWED
HIM
HIS
GOLD
SIR
IF
ANY
OTHER
COME
THAT
HATH
BETTER
IRON
THAN
YOU
HE
WILL
BE
MASTER
OF
ALL
THIS
GOLD
THEREFORE
LET
ANY
PRINCE
OR
STATE
THINK
SOLELY
OF
HIS
FORCES
EXCEPT
HIS
MILITIA
OF
NATIVES
BE
OF
GOOD
AND
VALIANT
SOLDIERS
AND
LET
PRINCES
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
THAT
HAVE
SUBJECTS
OF
MARTIAL
DISPOSITION
KNOW
THEIR
OWN
STRENGTH
UNLESS
THEY
BE
OTHERWISE
WANTING
UNTO
THEMSELVES
AS
FOR
MERCENARY
FORCES
WHICH
IS
THE
HELP
IN
THIS
CASE
ALL
EXAMPLES
SHOW
THAT
WHATSOEVER
ESTATE
OR
PRINCE
DOTH
REST
UPON
THEM
HE
MAY
SPREAD
HIS
FEATHERS
FOR
TIME
BUT
HE
WILL
MEW
THEM
SOON
AFTER
THE
BLESSING
OF
JUDAH
AND
ISSACHAR
WILL
NEVER
MEET
THAT
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
OR
NATION
SHOULD
BE
BOTH
THE
LION
WHELP
AND
THE
ASS
BETWEEN
BURTHENS
NEITHER
WILL
IT
BE
THAT
PEOPLE
OVERLAID
WITH
TAXES
SHOULD
EVER
BECOME
VALIANT
AND
MARTIAL
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
TAXES
LEVIED
BY
CONSENT
OF
THE
ESTATE
DO
ABATE
MEN
COURAGE
LESS
AS
IT
HATH
BEEN
SEEN
NOTABLY
IN
THE
EXCISES
OF
THE
LOW
COUNTRIES
AND
IN
SOME
DEGREE
IN
THE
SUBSIDIES
OF
ENGLAND
FOR
YOU
MUST
NOTE
THAT
WE
SPEAK
NOW
OF
THE
HEART
AND
NOT
OF
THE
PURSE
SO
THAT
ALTHOUGH
THE
SAME
TRIBUTE
AND
TAX
LAID
BY
CONSENT
OR
BY
IMPOSING
BE
ALL
ONE
TO
THE
PURSE
YET
IT
WORKS
DIVERSELY
UPON
THE
COURAGE
SO
THAT
YOU
MAY
CONCLUDE
THAT
NO
PEOPLE
OVERCHARGED
WITH
TRIBUTE
IS
FIT
FOR
EMPIRE
LET
STATES
THAT
AIM
AT
GREATNESS
TAKE
HEED
HOW
THEIR
NOBILITY
AND
GENTLEMEN
DO
MULTIPLY
TOO
FAST
FOR
THAT
MAKETH
THE
COMMON
SUBJECT
GROW
TO
BE
PEASANT
AND
BASE
SWAIN
DRIVEN
OUT
OF
HEART
AND
IN
EFFECT
BUT
THE
GENTLEMAN
LABORER
EVEN
AS
YOU
MAY
SEE
IN
COPPICE
WOODS
IF
YOU
LEAVE
YOUR
STADDLES
TOO
THICK
YOU
SHALL
NEVER
HAVE
CLEAN
UNDERWOOD
BUT
SHRUBS
AND
BUSHES
SO
IN
COUNTRIES
IF
THE
GENTLEMEN
BE
TOO
MANY
THE
COMMONS
WILL
BE
BASE
AND
YOU
WILL
BRING
IT
TO
THAT
THAT
NOT
THE
HUNDRED
POLL
WILL
BE
FIT
FOR
AN
HELMET
ESPECIALLY
AS
TO
THE
INFANTRY
WHICH
IS
THE
NERVE
OF
AN
ARMY
AND
SO
THERE
WILL
BE
GREAT
POPULATION
AND
LITTLE
STRENGTH
THIS
WHICH
SPEAK
OF
HATH
BEEN
NOWHERE
BETTER
SEEN
THAN
BY
COMPARING
OF
ENGLAND
AND
FRANCE
WHEREOF
ENGLAND
THOUGH
FAR
LESS
IN
TERRITORY
AND
POPULATION
HATH
BEEN
NEVERTHELESS
AN
OVERMATCH
IN
REGARD
THE
MIDDLE
PEOPLE
OF
ENGLAND
MAKE
GOOD
SOLDIERS
WHICH
THE
PEASANTS
OF
FRANCE
DO
NOT
AND
HEREIN
THE
DEVICE
OF
KING
HENRY
THE
SEVENTH
WHEREOF
HAVE
SPOKEN
LARGELY
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
HIS
LIFE
WAS
PROFOUND
AND
ADMIRABLE
IN
MAKING
FARMS
AND
HOUSES
OF
HUSBANDRY
OF
STANDARD
THAT
IS
MAINTAINED
WITH
SUCH
PROPORTION
OF

UNTO
THEM
AS
MAY
BREED
SUBJECT
TO
LIVE
IN
CONVENIENT
PLENTY
AND
NO
SERVILE
CONDITION
AND
TO
KEEP
THE
PLOUGH
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
THE

AND
NOT

HIRELINGS
AND
THUS
INDEED
YOU
SHALL
ATTAIN
TO
VIRGIL
CHARACTER
WHICH
HE
GIVES
TO
ANCIENT
ITALY
TERRA
POTENS
ARMIS
ATQUE
UBERE
GLEBAE
NEITHER
IS
THAT
STATE
WHICH
FOR
ANY
THING
KNOW
IS
ALMOST
PECULIAR
TO
ENGLAND
AND
HARDLY
TO
BE
FOUND
ANYWHERE
ELSE
EXCEPT
IT
BE
PERHAPS
IN
POLAND
TO
BE
PASSED
OVER
MEAN
THE
STATE
OF
FREE
SERVANTS
AND

UPON
NOBLEMEN
AND
GENTLEMEN
WHICH
ARE
NO
WAYS
INFERIOR
UNTO
THE
YEOMANRY
FOR

AND
THEREFORE
OUT
OF
ALL

THE
SPLENDOR
AND
MAGNIFICENCE
AND
GREAT
RETINUES
AND
HOSPITALITY
OF
NOBLEMEN
AND
GENTLEMEN
RECEIVED
INTO

DOTH
MUCH
CONDUCE

WHEREAS
CONTRARIWISE
THE
CLOSE
AND

LIVING
OF
NOBLEMEN
AND
GENTLEMEN
CAUSETH
PENURY
OF
MILITARY
FORCES
BY
ALL
MEANS
IT
IS
TO
BE
PROCURED
THAT
THE
TRUNK
OF
NEBUCHADNEZZAR
TREE
OF
MONARCHY
BE
GREAT
ENOUGH
TO
BEAR
THE
BRANCHES
AND
THE
BOUGHS
THAT
IS
THAT
THE
NATURAL
SUBJECTS
OF
THE
CROWN
OR
STATE
BEAR
SUFFICIENT
PROPORTION
TO
THE
STRANGER
SUBJECTS
THAT
THEY
GOVERN
THEREFORE
ALL
STATES
THAT
ARE
LIBERAL
OF
NATURALIZATION
TOWARDS
STRANGERS
ARE
FIT
FOR

FOR
TO
THINK
THAT
AN
HANDFUL
OF
PEOPLE
CAN
WITH
THE
GREATEST
COURAGE
AND
POLICY
IN
THE
WORLD
EMBRACE
TOO
LARGE
EXTENT
OF
DOMINION
IT
MAY
HOLD
FOR
TIME
BUT
IT
WILL
FAIL
SUDDENLY
THE
SPARTANS
WERE
NICE
PEOPLE
IN
POINT
OF
NATURALIZATION
WHEREBY
WHILE
THEY
KEPT
THEIR
COMPASS
THEY
STOOD
FIRM
BUT
WHEN
THEY
DID
SPREAD
AND
THEIR
BOUGHS
WERE
BECOMEN
TOO
GREAT
FOR
THEIR
STEM
THEY
BECAME
WINDFALL
UPON
THE
SUDDEN
NEVER
ANY
STATE
WAS
IN
THIS
POINT
SO
OPEN
TO
RECEIVE
STRANGERS
INTO
THEIR
BODY
AS
WERE
THE
ROMANS
THEREFORE
IT
SORTED
WITH
THEM
ACCORDINGLY
FOR
THEY
GREW
TO
THE
GREATEST
MONARCHY
THEIR
MANNER
WAS
TO
GRANT
NATURALIZATION
WHICH
THEY
CALLED
JUS
CIVITATIS
AND
TO
GRANT
IT
IN
THE
HIGHEST
DEGREE
THAT
IS
NOT
ONLY
JUS
COMMERCII
JUS
CONNUBII
JUS
HAEREDITATIS
BUT
ALSO
JUS
SUFFRAGII
AND
JUS
HONORUM
AND
THIS
NOT
TO
SINGULAR
PERSONS
ALONE
BUT
LIKEWISE
TO
WHOLE
FAMILIES
YEA
TO
CITIES
AND
SOMETIMES
TO
NATIONS
ADD
TO
THIS
THEIR
CUSTOM
OF
PLANTATION
OF
COLONIES
WHEREBY
THE
ROMAN
PLANT
WAS
REMOVED
INTO
THE
SOIL
OF
OTHER
NATIONS
AND
PUTTING
BOTH
CONSTITUTIONS
TOGETHER
YOU
WILL
SAY
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
ROMANS
THAT
SPREAD
UPON
THE
WORLD
BUT
IT
WAS
THE
WORLD
THAT
SPREAD
UPON
THE
ROMANS
AND
THAT
WAS
THE
SURE
WAY
OF
GREATNESS
HAVE
MARVELLED
SOMETIMES
AT
SPAIN
HOW
THEY
CLASP
AND
CONTAIN
SO
LARGE
DOMINIONS
WITH
SO
FEW
NATURAL
SPANIARDS
BUT
SURE
THE
WHOLE
COMPASS
OF
SPAIN
IS
VERY
GREAT
BODY
OF
TREE
FAR
ABOVE
ROME
AND
SPARTA
AT
THE
FIRST
AND
BESIDES
THOUGH
THEY
HAVE
NOT
HAD
THAT
USAGE
TO
NATURALIZE
LIBERALLY
YET
THEY
HAVE
THAT
WHICH
IS
NEXT
TO
IT
THAT
IS
TO
EMPLOY
ALMOST
INDIFFERENTLY
ALL
NATIONS
IN
THEIR
MILITIA
OF
ORDINARY
SOLDIERS
YEA
AND
SOMETIMES
IN
THEIR
HIGHEST
COMMANDS
NAY
IT
SEEMETH
AT
THIS
INSTANT
THEY
ARE
SENSIBLE
OF
THIS
WANT
OF
NATIVES
AS
BY
THE
PRAGMATICAL
SANCTION
NOW
PUBLISHED
APPEARETH
IT
IS
CERTAIN
THAT
SEDENTARY
AND
WITHIN
DOOR
ARTS
AND
DELICATE
MANUFACTURES
THAT
REQUIRE
RATHER
THE
FINGER
THAN
THE
ARM
HAVE
IN
THEIR
NATURE
CONTRARIETY
TO
MILITARY
DISPOSITION
AND
GENERALLY
ALL
WARLIKE
PEOPLE
ARE
LITTLE
IDLE
AND
LOVE
DANGER
BETTER
THAN
TRAVAIL
NEITHER
MUST
THEY
BE
TOO
MUCH
BROKEN
OF
IT
IF
THEY
SHALL
BE
PRESERVED
IN
VIGOR
THEREFORE
IT
WAS
GREAT
ADVANTAGE
IN
THE
ANCIENT
STATES
OF
SPARTA
ATHENS
ROME
AND
OTHERS
THAT
THEY
HAD
THE
USE
OF
SLAVES
WHICH
COMMONLY
DID
RID
THOSE
MANUFACTURES
BUT
THAT
IS
ABOLISHED
IN
GREATEST
PART
BY
THE
CHRISTIAN
LAW
THAT
WHICH
COMETH
NEAREST
TO
IT
IS
TO
LEAVE
THOSE
ARTS
CHIEFLY
TO
STRANGERS
WHICH
FOR
THAT
PURPOSE
ARE
THE
MORE
EASILY
TO
BE
RECEIVED
AND
TO
CONTAIN
THE
PRINCIPAL
BULK
OF
THE
VULGAR
NATIVES
WITHIN
THOSE
THREE
KINDS
TILLERS
OF
THE
GROUND
FREE
SERVANTS
AND
HANDICRAFTSMEN
OF
STRONG
AND
MANLY
ARTS
AS
SMITHS
MASONS
CARPENTERS
ETC
NOT
RECKONING
PROFESSED
SOLDIERS
BUT
ABOVE
ALL
FOR
EMPIRE
AND
GREATNESS
IT
IMPORTETH
MOST
THAT
NATION
DO
PROFESS
ARMS
AS
THEIR
PRINCIPAL
HONOR
STUDY
AND
OCCUPATION
FOR
THE
THINGS
WHICH
WE
FORMERLY
HAVE
SPOKEN
OF
ARE
BUT
HABILITATIONS
TOWARDS
ARMS
AND
WHAT
IS
HABILITATION
WITHOUT
INTENTION
AND
ACT
ROMULUS
AFTER
HIS
DEATH
AS
THEY
REPORT
OR
FEIGN
SENT
PRESENT
TO
THE
ROMANS
THAT
ABOVE
ALL
THEY
SHOULD
INTEND
ARMS
AND
THEN
THEY
SHOULD
PROVE
THE
GREATEST
EMPIRE
OF
THE
WORLD
THE
FABRIC
OF
THE
STATE
OF
SPARTA
WAS
WHOLLY
THOUGH
NOT
WISELY
FRAMED
AND
COMPOSED
TO
THAT
SCOPE
AND
END
THE
PERSIANS
AND
MACEDONIANS
HAD
IT
FOR
FLASH
THE
GAULS
GERMANS
GOTHS
SAXONS
NORMANS
AND
OTHERS
HAD
IT
FOR
TIME
THE
TURKS
HAVE
IT
AT
THIS
DAY
THOUGH
IN
GREAT
DECLINATION
OF
CHRISTIAN
EUROPE
THEY
THAT
HAVE
IT
ARE
IN
EFFECT
ONLY
THE
SPANIARDS
BUT
IT
IS
SO
PLAIN
THAT
EVERY
MAN
PROFITETH
IN
THAT
HE
MOST
INTENDETH
THAT
IT
NEEDETH
NOT
TO
BE
STOOD
UPON
IT
IS
ENOUGH
TO
POINT
AT
IT
THAT
NO
NATION
WHICH
DOTH
NOT
DIRECTLY
PROFESS
ARMS
MAY
LOOK
TO
HAVE
GREATNESS
FALL
INTO
THEIR
MOUTHS
AND
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
IT
IS
MOST
CERTAIN
ORACLE
OF
TIME
THAT
THOSE
STATES
THAT
CONTINUE
LONG
IN
THAT
PROFESSION
AS
THE
ROMANS
AND
TURKS
PRINCIPALLY
HAVE
DONE
DO
WONDERS
AND
THOSE
THAT
HAVE
PROFESSED
ARMS
BUT
FOR
AN
AGE
HAVE
NOTWITHSTANDING
COMMONLY
ATTAINED
THAT
GREATNESS
IN
THAT
AGE
WHICH
MAINTAINED
THEM
LONG
AFTER
WHEN
THEIR
PROFESSION
AND
EXERCISE
OF
ARMS
HATH
GROWN
TO
DECAY
INCIDENT
TO
THIS
POINT
IS
FOR
STATE
TO
HAVE
THOSE
LAWS
OR
CUSTOMS
WHICH
MAY
REACH
FORTH
UNTO
THEM
JUST
OCCASIONS
AS
MAY
BE
PRETENDED
OF
WAR
FOR
THERE
IS
THAT
JUSTICE
IMPRINTED
IN
THE
NATURE
OF
MEN
THAT
THEY
ENTER
NOT
UPON
WARS
WHEREOF
SO
MANY
CALAMITIES
DO
ENSUE
BUT
UPON
SOME
AT
THE
LEAST
SPECIOUS
GROUNDS
AND
QUARRELS
THE
TURK
HATH
AT
HAND
FOR
CAUSE
OF
WAR
THE
PROPAGATION
OF
HIS
LAW
OR
SECT
QUARREL
THAT
HE
MAY
ALWAYS
COMMAND
THE
ROMANS
THOUGH
THEY
ESTEEMED
THE
EXTENDING
THE
LIMITS
OF
THEIR
EMPIRE
TO
BE
GREAT
HONOR
TO
THEIR
GENERALS
WHEN
IT
WAS
DONE
YET
THEY
NEVER
RESTED
UPON
THAT
ALONE
TO
BEGIN
WAR
FIRST
THEREFORE
LET
NATIONS
THAT
PRETEND
TO
GREATNESS
HAVE
THIS
THAT
THEY
BE
SENSIBLE
OF
WRONGS
EITHER
UPON
BORDERERS
MERCHANTS
OR
POLITIC
MINISTERS
AND
THAT
THEY
SIT
NOT
TOO
LONG
UPON
PROVOCATION
SECONDLY
LET
THEM
BE
PREST
AND
READY
TO
GIVE
AIDS
AND
SUCCORS
TO
THEIR
CONFEDERATES
AS
IT
EVER
WAS
WITH
THE
ROMANS
INSOMUCH
AS
IF
THE
CONFEDERATE
HAD
LEAGUES
DEFENSIVE
WITH
DIVERS
OTHER
STATES
AND
UPON
INVASION
OFFERED
DID
IMPLORE
THEIR
AIDS
SEVERALLY
YET
THE
ROMANS
WOULD
EVER
BE
THE
FOREMOST
AND
LEAVE
IT
TO
NONE
OTHER
TO
HAVE
THE
HONOR
AS
FOR
THE
WARS
WHICH
WERE
ANCIENTLY
MADE
ON
THE
BEHALF
OF
KIND
OF
PARTY
OR
TACIT
CONFORMITY
OF
ESTATE
DO
NOT
SEE
HOW
THEY
MAY
BE
WELL
JUSTIFIED
AS
WHEN
THE
ROMANS
MADE
WAR
FOR
THE
LIBERTY
OF
GRECIA
OR
WHEN
THE
LACEDAEMONIANS
AND
ATHENIANS
MADE
WARS
TO
SET
UP
OR
PULL
DOWN
DEMOCRACIES
AND
OLIGARCHIES
OR
WHEN
WARS
WERE
MADE
BY
FOREIGNERS
UNDER
THE
PRETENCE
OF
JUSTICE
OR
PROTECTION
TO
DELIVER
THE
SUBJECTS
OF
OTHERS
FROM
TYRANNY
AND
OPPRESSION
AND
THE
LIKE
LET
IT
SUFFICE
THAT
NO
ESTATE
EXPECT
TO
BE
GREAT
THAT
IS
NOT
AWAKE
UPON
ANY
JUST
OCCASION
OF
ARMING
NO
BODY
CAN
BE
HEALTHFUL
WITHOUT
EXERCISE
NEITHER
NATURAL
BODY
NOR
POLITIC
AND
CERTAINLY
TO
KINGDOM
OR

JUST
AND
HONORABLE
WAR
IS
THE
TRUE
EXERCISE
CIVIL
WAR
INDEED
IS
LIKE
THE
HEAT
OF
FEVER
BUT
FOREIGN
WAR
IS
LIKE
THE
HEAT
OF
EXERCISE
AND
SERVETH
TO
KEEP
THE
BODY
IN
HEALTH
FOR
IN
SLOTHFUL
PEACE
BOTH
COURAGES
WILL
EFFEMINATE
AND
MANNERS
CORRUPT
BUT
HOWSOEVER
IT
BE
FOR
HAPPINESS
WITHOUT
ALL
QUESTION
FOR
GREATNESS
IT
MAKETH
TO
BE
STILL
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
IN
ARMS
AND
THE
STRENGTH
OF
VETERAN

THOUGH
IT
BE
CHARGEABLE
BUSINESS
ALWAYS
ON

IS
THAT
WHICH
COMMONLY
GIVETH
THE

OR
AT

THE
REPUTATION
AMONGST
ALL

AS
MAY

BE
SEEN
IN

ALMOST
CONTINUALLY
NOW
BY
THE
SPACE
OF
SIX

TO

THE
GREAT
EFFECTS
OF
BATTLES
BY

THE
BATTLE
OF
ACTIUM
DECIDED
THE
EMPIRE
OF
THE

THE
BATTLE
OF

ARRESTED
THE
GREATNESS
OF
THE
TURK
THERE
BE
MANY
EXAMPLES
WHERE
SEA
FIGHTS
HAVE
BEEN
FINAL
TO
THE
WAR
BUT
THIS
IS
WHEN
PRINCES
OR
STATES
HAVE
SET
UP
THEIR
REST
UPON

BUT
THUS
MUCH
IS
CERTAIN
THAT

THAT

AND

WHEREAS

NEVERTHELESS
IN

SURELY
AT

WITH

OF

THE
VANTAGE
OF

AT

WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
PRINCIPAL
DOWRIES
OF
THIS
KINGDOM
OF

BRITAIN
IS
GREAT
BOTH
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
THE

OF

ARE
NOT

INLAND
BUT
GIRT
WITH
THE

MOST
PART
OF
THEIR
COMPASS
AND
BECAUSE
THE

OF
BOTH
INDIES
SEEMS
IN
GREAT

BUT
AN
ACCESSORY
TO
THE

OF
THE

THE

OF
LATTER
AGES
SEEM
TO
BE
MADE
IN
THE
DARK
IN

OF
THE
GLORY
AND
HONOR
WHICH
REFLECTED
UPON
MEN
FROM
THE

IN
ANCIENT
TIME
THERE
BE
NOW
FOR
MARTIAL
ENCOURAGEMENT
SOME
DEGREES
AND
ORDERS
OF
CHIVALRY
WHICH
NEVERTHELESS
ARE
CONFERRED
PROMISCUOUSLY
UPON
SOLDIERS
AND
NO
SOLDIERS
AND
SOME
REMEMBRANCE
PERHAPS
UPON
THE
SCUTCHEON
AND
SOME
HOSPITALS
FOR
MAIMED
SOLDIERS
AND
SUCH
LIKE
THINGS
BUT
IN
ANCIENT
TIMES
THE
TROPHIES
ERECTED
UPON
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
VICTORY
THE
FUNERAL
LAUDATIVES
AND
MONUMENTS
FOR
THOSE
THAT
DIED
IN
THE
WARS
THE
CROWNS
AND

PERSONAL
THE
STYLE
OF
EMPEROR
WHICH
THE
GREAT
KINGS
OF
THE
WORLD
AFTER
BORROWED
THE
TRIUMPHS
OF
THE
GENERALS
UPON
THEIR
RETURN
THE
GREAT
DONATIVES
AND
LARGESSES
UPON
THE
DISBANDING
OF
THE
ARMIES
WERE
THINGS
ABLE
TO
INFLAME
ALL
MEN
COURAGES
BUT
ABOVE
ALL
THAT
OF
THE
TRIUMPH
AMONGST
THE
ROMANS
WAS
NOT
PAGEANTS
OR
GAUDERY
BUT
ONE
OF
THE
WISEST
AND
NOBLEST
INSTITUTIONS
THAT
EVER
WAS
FOR
IT
CONTAINED
THREE
THINGS
HONOR
TO
THE
GENERAL
RICHES
TO
THE
TREASURY
OUT
OF
THE
SPOILS
AND
DONATIVES
TO
THE
ARMY
BUT
THAT
HONOR
PERHAPS
WERE
NOT
FIT
FOR
MONARCHIES
EXCEPT
IT
BE
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
THE
MONARCH
HIMSELF
OR
HIS
SONS
AS
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
THE
TIMES
OF
THE
ROMAN
EMPERORS
WHO
DID
IMPROPRIATE
THE
ACTUAL
TRIUMPHS
TO
THEMSELVES
AND
THEIR
SONS
FOR
SUCH
WARS
AS
THEY
DID
ACHIEVE
IN
PERSON
AND
LEFT
ONLY
FOR
WARS
ACHIEVED
BY
SUBJECTS
SOME
TRIUMPHAL
GARMENTS
AND
ENSIGNS
TO
THE
GENERAL
TO
CONCLUDE
NO
MAN
CAN
BY
CARE
TAKING
AS
THE
SCRIPTURE
SAITH
ADD
CUBIT
TO
HIS
STATURE
IN
THIS
LITTLE
MODEL
OF
MAN
BODY
BUT
IN
THE
GREAT
FRAME
OF
KINGDOMS
AND
COMMONWEALTHS
IT
IS
IN
THE
POWER
OF
PRINCES
OR
ESTATES
TO
ADD
AMPLITUDE
AND
GREATNESS
TO
THEIR
KINGDOMS
FOR
BY
INTRODUCING
SUCH
ORDINANCES
CONSTITUTIONS
AND
CUSTOMS
AS
WE
HAVE
NOW
TOUCHED
THEY
MAY
SOW
GREATNESS
TO
THEIR
POSTERITY
AND
SUCCESSION
BUT
THESE
THINGS
ARE
COMMONLY
NOT
OBSERVED
BUT
LEFT
TO
TAKE
THEIR
CHANCE
OF
REGIMENT
OF
HEALTH
THERE
IS
WISDOM
IN
THIS
BEYOND
THE
RULES
OF
PHYSIC
MAN
OWN
OBSERVATION
WHAT
HE
FINDS
GOOD
OF
AND
WHAT
HE
FINDS
HURT
OF
IS
THE
BEST
PHYSIC
TO
PRESERVE
HEALTH
BUT
IT
IS
SAFER
CONCLUSION
TO
SAY
THIS
AGREETH
NOT
WELL
WITH
ME
THEREFORE
WILL
NOT
CONTINUE
IT
THAN
THIS
FIND
NO
OFFENCE
OF
THIS
THEREFORE
MAY
USE
IT
FOR
STRENGTH
OF
NATURE
IN
YOUTH
PASSETH
OVER
MANY
EXCESSES
WHICH
ARE
OWING
MAN
TILL
HIS
AGE
DISCERN
OF
THE
COMING
ON
OF
YEARS
AND
THINK
NOT
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THINGS
STILL
FOR
AGE
WILL
NOT
BE
DEFIED
BEWARE
OF
SUDDEN
CHANGE
IN
ANY
GREAT
POINT
OF
DIET
AND
IF
NECESSITY
ENFORCE
IT
FIT
THE
REST
TO
IT
FOR
IT
IS
SECRET
BOTH
IN
NATURE
AND
STATE
THAT
IT
IS
SAFER
TO
CHANGE
MANY
THINGS
THAN
ONE
EXAMINE
THY
CUSTOMS
OF
DIET
SLEEP
EXERCISE
APPAREL
AND
THE
LIKE
AND
TRY
IN
ANY
THING
THOU
SHALT
JUDGE
HURTFUL
TO
DISCONTINUE
IT
BY
LITTLE
AND
LITTLE
BUT
SO
AS
IF
THOU
DOST
FIND
ANY
INCONVENIENCE
BY
THE
CHANGE
THOU
COME
BACK
TO
IT
AGAIN
FOR
IT
IS
HARD
TO
DISTINGUISH
THAT
WHICH
IS
GENERALLY
HELD
GOOD
AND
WHOLESOME
FROM
THAT
WHICH
IS
GOOD
PARTICULARLY
AND
FIT
FOR
THINE
OWN
BODY
TO
BE
FREE
MINDED
AND
CHEERFULLY
DISPOSED
AT
HOURS
OF
MEAT
AND
OF
SLEEP
AND
OF
EXERCISE
IS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
PRECEPTS
OF
LONG
LASTING
AS
FOR
THE
PASSIONS
AND
STUDIES
OF
THE

AVOID
ENVY
ANXIOUS
FEARS
ANGER
FRETTING

SUBTLE
AND
KNOTTY
INQUISITIONS
JOYS
AND
EXHILARATIONS
IN

ENTERTAIN
HOPES

RATHER
THAN

VARIETY
OF

RATHER
THAN

OF

WONDER
AND

AND
THEREFORE
NOVELTIES
STUDIES
THAT
FILL
THE
MIND
WITH
SPLENDID
AND
ILLUSTRIOUS
OBJECTS
AS
HISTORIES
FABLES
AND
CONTEMPLATIONS
OF
NATURE
IF
YOU
FLY
PHYSIC
IN

ALTOGETHER
IT
WILL
BE
TOO
STRANGE
FOR
YOUR

WHEN
YOU
SHALL
NEED
IT
IF
YOU
MAKE
IT
TOO
FAMILIAR
IT
WILL
WORK
NO
EXTRAORDINARY
EFFECT
WHEN
SICKNESS
COMETH

RATHER
SOME

FOR

FOR

ALTER
THE

AND

IT

DESPISE
NO

ASK

RESPECT

PRINCIPALLY
AND
IN

ACTION
FOR
THOSE
THAT
PUT
THEIR

MAY
IN

SICKNESSES
WHICH
ARE
NOT

SHARP
BE
CURED
ONLY
WITH

CELSUS
COULD
NEVER
HAVE
SPOKEN

HAD

NOT
BEEN
WISE
MAN

WHEN

GIVETH
IT
FOR
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
PRECEPTS
OF

AND
LASTING
THAT
MAN
DO
VARY
AND
INTERCHANGE
CONTRARIES
BUT
WITH
AN
INCLINATION
TO
THE
MORE
BENIGN
EXTREME
USE
FASTING
AND
FULL
EATING
BUT
RATHER
FULL
EATING
WATCHING
AND
SLEEP
BUT
RATHER
SLEEP
SITTING
AND
EXERCISE
BUT
RATHER
EXERCISE
AND
THE
LIKE
SO
SHALL
NATURE
BE
CHERISHED
AND
YET
TAUGHT
MASTERIES
PHYSICIANS
ARE
SOME
OF
THEM
SO
PLEASING
AND
CONFORMABLE
TO
THE
HUMOR
OF
THE
PATIENT
AS
THEY
PRESS
NOT
THE
TRUE
CURE
OF
THE
DISEASE
AND
SOME
OTHER
ARE
SO
REGULAR
IN
PROCEEDING
ACCORDING
TO
ART
FOR
THE
DISEASE
AS
THEY
RESPECT
NOT
SUFFICIENTLY
THE
CONDITION
OF
THE
PATIENT
TAKE
ONE
OF
MIDDLE
TEMPER
OR
IF
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
FOUND
IN
ONE
MAN
COMBINE
TWO
OF
EITHER
SORT
AND
FORGET
NOT
TO
CALL
AS
WELL
THE
BEST
ACQUAINTED
WITH
YOUR
BODY
AS
THE
BEST
REPUTED
OF
FOR
HIS
FACULTY
OF
SUSPICION
SUSPICIONS
AMONGST
THOUGHTS
ARE
LIKE
BATS
AMONGST
BIRDS
THEY
EVER
FLY
BY
TWILIGHT
CERTAINLY
THEY
ARE
TO
BE
REPRESSED
OR
AT
LEAST
WELL
GUARDED
FOR
THEY
CLOUD
THE
MIND
THEY
LEESE
FRIENDS
AND
THEY
CHECK
WITH
BUSINESS
WHEREBY
BUSINESS
CANNOT
GO
ON
CURRENTLY
AND
CONSTANTLY
THEY
DISPOSE
KINGS
TO
TYRANNY
HUSBANDS
TO
JEALOUSY
WISE
MEN
TO
IRRESOLUTION
AND
MELANCHOLY
THEY
ARE
DEFECTS
NOT
IN
THE
HEART
BUT
IN
THE
BRAIN
FOR
THEY
TAKE
PLACE
IN
THE
STOUTEST
NATURES
AS
IN
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
HENRY
THE
SEVENTH
OF
ENGLAND
THERE
WAS
NOT
MORE
SUSPICIOUS
MAN
NOR
MORE
STOUT
AND
IN
SUCH
COMPOSITION
THEY
DO
SMALL
HURT
FOR
COMMONLY
THEY
ARE
NOT
ADMITTED
BUT
WITH
EXAMINATION
WHETHER
THEY
BE
LIKELY
OR
NO
BUT
IN
FEARFUL
NATURES
THEY
GAIN
GROUND
TOO
FAST
THERE
IS
NOTHING
MAKES
MAN
SUSPECT
MUCH
MORE
THAN
TO
KNOW
LITTLE
AND
THEREFORE
MEN
SHOULD
REMEDY
SUSPICION
BY
PROCURING
TO
KNOW
MORE
AND
NOT
TO
KEEP
THEIR
SUSPICIONS
IN
SMOTHER
WHAT
WOULD
MEN
HAVE
DO
THEY
THINK
THOSE
THEY
EMPLOY
AND
DEAL
WITH
ARE
SAINTS
DO
THEY
NOT
THINK
THEY
WILL
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
ENDS
AND
BE
TRUER
TO
THEMSELVES
THAN
TO
THEM
THEREFORE
THERE
IS
NO
BETTER
WAY
TO
MODERATE
SUSPICIONS
THAN
TO
ACCOUNT
UPON
SUCH
SUSPICIONS
AS
TRUE
AND
YET
TO
BRIDLE
THEM
AS
FALSE
FOR
SO
FAR
MAN
OUGHT
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
SUSPICIONS
AS
TO
PROVIDE
AS
IF
THAT
SHOULD
BE
TRUE
THAT
HE
SUSPECTS
YET
IT
MAY
DO
HIM
NO
HURT
SUSPICIONS
THAT
THE
MIND
OF
ITSELF
GATHERS
ARE
BUT
BUZZES
BUT
SUSPICIONS
THAT
ARE
ARTIFICIALLY
NOURISHED
AND
PUT
INTO
MEN
HEADS
BY
THE
TALES
AND
WHISPERINGS
OF
OTHERS
HAVE
STINGS
CERTAINLY
THE
BEST
MEAN
TO
CLEAR
THE
WAY
IN
THIS
SAME
WOOD
OF
SUSPICIONS
IS
FRANKLY
TO
COMMUNICATE
THEM
WITH
THE
PARTY
THAT
HE
SUSPECTS
FOR
THEREBY
HE
SHALL
BE
SURE
TO
KNOW
MORE
OF
THE
TRUTH
OF
THEM
THAN
HE
DID
BEFORE
AND
WITHAL
SHALL
MAKE
THAT
PARTY
MORE
CIRCUMSPECT
NOT
TO
GIVE
FURTHER
CAUSE
OF
SUSPICION
BUT
THIS
WOULD
NOT
BE
DONE
TO
MEN
OF
BASE
NATURES
FOR
THEY
IF
THEY
FIND
THEMSELVES
ONCE
SUSPECTED
WILL
NEVER
BE
TRUE
THE
ITALIAN
SAYS
SOSPETTO
LICENTIA
FEDE
AS
IF
SUSPICION
DID
GIVE
PASSPORT
TO
FAITH
BUT
IT
OUGHT
RATHER
TO
KINDLE
IT
TO
DISCHARGE
ITSELF
OF
DISCOURSE
SOME
IN
THEIR
DISCOURSE
DESIRE
RATHER
COMMENDATION
OF
WIT
IN
BEING
ABLE
TO
HOLD
ALL
ARGUMENTS
THAN
OF
JUDGMENT
IN
DISCERNING
WHAT
IS
TRUE
AS
IF
IT
WERE
PRAISE
TO
KNOW
WHAT
MIGHT
BE
SAID
AND
NOT
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
THOUGHT
SOME
HAVE
CERTAIN
COMMON
PLACES
AND
THEMES
WHEREIN
THEY
ARE
GOOD
AND
WANT
VARIETY
WHICH
KIND
OF
POVERTY
IS
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
TEDIOUS
AND
WHEN
IT
IS
ONCE
PERCEIVED
RIDICULOUS
THE
HONORABLEST
PART
OF
TALK
IS
TO
GIVE
THE
OCCASION
AND
AGAIN
TO
MODERATE
AND
PASS
TO
SOMEWHAT
ELSE
FOR
THEN
MAN
LEADS
THE
DANCE
IT
IS
GOOD
IN
DISCOURSE
AND
SPEECH
OF
CONVERSATION
TO
VARY
AND
INTERMINGLE
SPEECH
OF
THE
PRESENT
OCCASION
WITH
ARGUMENTS
TALES
WITH
REASONS
ASKING
OF
QUESTIONS
WITH
TELLING
OF
OPINIONS
AND
JEST
WITH
EARNEST
FOR
IT
IS
DULL
THING
TO
TIRE
AND
AS
WE
SAY
NOW
TO
JADE
ANY
THING
TOO
FAR
AS
FOR
JEST
THERE
BE
CERTAIN
THINGS
WHICH
OUGHT
TO
BE
PRIVILEGED
FROM
IT
NAMELY
RELIGION
MATTERS
OF
STATE
GREAT
PERSONS
ANY
MAN
PRESENT
BUSINESS
OF
IMPORTANCE
AND
ANY
CASE
THAT
DESERVETH
PITY
YET
THERE
BE
SOME
THAT
THINK
THEIR
WITS
HAVE
BEEN
ASLEEP
EXCEPT
THEY
DART
OUT
SOMEWHAT
THAT
IS
PIQUANT
AND
TO
THE
QUICK
THAT
IS
VEIN
WHICH
WOULD
BE
BRIDLED
PARCE
PUER
STIMULIS
ET
FORTIUS
UTERE
LORIS
AND
GENERALLY
MEN
OUGHT
TO
FIND
THE

BETWEEN
SALTNESS
AND
BITTERNESS
CERTAINLY
HE
THAT
HATH
SATIRICAL
VEIN
AS
HE
MAKETH
OTHERS
AFRAID
OF
HIS
WIT
SO
HE
HAD
NEED
BE
AFRAID
OF
OTHERS
MEMORY
HE
THAT
QUESTIONETH
MUCH
SHALL
LEARN
MUCH
AND
CONTENT
MUCH
BUT
ESPECIALLY
IF
HE
APPLY
HIS
QUESTIONS
TO
THE
SKILL
OF
THE
PERSONS
WHOM
HE
ASKETH
FOR
HE
SHALL
GIVE
THEM
OCCASION
TO
PLEASE
THEMSELVES
IN
SPEAKING
AND
HIMSELF
SHALL
CONTINUALLY
GATHER
KNOWLEDGE
BUT
LET
HIS
QUESTIONS
NOT
BE
TROUBLESOME
FOR
THAT
IS
FIT
FOR
POSER
AND
LET
HIM
BE
SURE
TO
LEAVE
OTHER
MEN
THEIR
TURNS
TO
SPEAK
NAY
IF
THERE
BE
ANY
THAT
WOULD
REIGN
AND
TAKE
UP
ALL
THE
TIME
LET
HIM
FIND
MEANS
TO
TAKE
THEM
OFF
AND
TO
BRING
OTHERS
ON
AS
MUSICIANS
USE
TO
DO
WITH
THOSE
THAT
DANCE
TOO
LONG
GALLIARDS
IF
YOU
DISSEMBLE
SOMETIMES
YOUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THAT
YOU
ARE
THOUGHT
TO

YOU
SHALL
BE
THOUGHT
ANOTHER

TO
KNOW
THAT
YOU

NOT

OF

SELF
OUGHT
TO
BE
SELDOM
AND
WELL
CHOSEN
KNEW
ONE
WAS
WONT
TO
SAY
IN
SCORN
HE
MUST
NEEDS
BE
WISE
MAN
HE
SPEAKS
SO
MUCH
OF
HIMSELF
AND
THERE
IS
BUT
ONE
CASE
WHEREIN
MAN
MAY
COMMEND
HIMSELF
WITH
GOOD
GRACE
AND
THAT
IS
IN
COMMENDING
VIRTUE
IN
ANOTHER
ESPECIALLY
IF
IT
BE
SUCH
VIRTUE
WHEREUNTO
HIMSELF
PRETENDETH
SPEECH
OF
TOUCH
TOWARDS
OTHERS
SHOULD
BE
SPARINGLY
USED
FOR
DISCOURSE
OUGHT
TO
BE
AS
FIELD
WITHOUT
COMING
HOME
TO
ANY
MAN
KNEW
TWO
NOBLEMEN
OF
THE
WEST
PART
OF
ENGLAND
WHEREOF
THE
ONE
WAS
GIVEN
TO
SCOFF
BUT
KEPT
EVER
ROYAL
CHEER
IN
HIS
HOUSE
THE
OTHER
WOULD
ASK
OF
THOSE
THAT
HAD
BEEN
AT
THE
OTHER
TABLE
TELL
TRULY
WAS
THERE
NEVER
FLOUT
OR
DRY
BLOW
GIVEN
TO
WHICH
THE
GUEST
WOULD
ANSWER
SUCH
AND
SUCH
THING
PASSED
THE
LORD
WOULD
SAY
THOUGHT
HE
WOULD
MAR
GOOD
DINNER
DISCRETION
OF
SPEECH
IS
MORE
THAN
ELOQUENCE
AND
TO
SPEAK
AGREEABLY
TO
HIM
WITH
WHOM
WE
DEAL
IS
MORE
THAN
TO
SPEAK
IN
GOOD
WORDS
OR
IN
GOOD
ORDER
GOOD
CONTINUED
SPEECH
WITHOUT
GOOD
SPEECH
OF
INTERLOCUTION
SHOWS
SLOWNESS
AND
GOOD
REPLY
OR
SECOND
SPEECH
WITHOUT
GOOD
SETTLED
SPEECH
SHOWETH
SHALLOWNESS
AND
WEAKNESS
AS
WE
SEE
IN
BEASTS
THAT
THOSE
THAT
ARE
WEAKEST
IN
THE
COURSE
ARE
YET
NIMBLEST
IN
THE

AS
IT
IS
BETWIXT
THE
GREYHOUND
AND
THE
HARE
TO
USE
TOO
MANY
CIRCUMSTANCES
ERE
ONE
COME
TO
THE
MATTER
IS
WEARISOME
TO
USE
NONE
AT
ALL
IS
BLUNT
OF
PLANTATIONS
PLANTATIONS
ARE
AMONGST
ANCIENT
PRIMITIVE
AND
HEROICAL
WORKS
WHEN
THE
WORLD
WAS
YOUNG
IT
BEGAT
MORE
CHILDREN
BUT
NOW
IT
IS
OLD
IT
BEGETS
FEWER
FOR
MAY
JUSTLY
ACCOUNT
NEW
PLANTATIONS
TO
BE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
FORMER
KINGDOMS
LIKE
PLANTATION
IN
PURE
SOIL
THAT
IS
WHERE
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
DISPLANTED
TO
THE
END
TO
PLANT
IN
OTHERS
FOR
ELSE
IT
IS
RATHER
AN
EXTIRPATION
THAN
PLANTATION
PLANTING
OF
COUNTRIES
IS
LIKE
PLANTING
OF
WOODS
FOR
YOU
MUST
MAKE
ACCOUNT
TO
LEESE
ALMOST
TWENTY
YEARS
PROFIT
AND
EXPECT
YOUR
RECOMPENSE
IN
THE
END
FOR
THE
PRINCIPAL
THING
THAT
HATH
BEEN
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
MOST
PLANTATIONS
HATH
BEEN
THE
BASE
AND
HASTY
DRAWING
OF
PROFIT
IN
THE
FIRST
YEARS
IT
IS
TRUE
SPEEDY
PROFIT
IS
NOT
TO
BE
NEGLECTED
AS
FAR
AS
MAY
STAND
WITH
THE
GOOD
OF
THE
PLANTATION
BUT
NO
FURTHER
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
AND
UNBLESSED
THING
TO
TAKE
THE
SCUM
OF
PEOPLE
AND
WICKED
CONDEMNED
MEN
TO
BE
THE
PEOPLE
WITH
WHOM
YOU
PLANT
AND
NOT
ONLY
SO
BUT
IT
SPOILETH
THE
PLANTATION
FOR
THEY
WILL
EVER
LIVE
LIKE
ROGUES
AND
NOT
FALL
TO
WORK
BUT
BE
LAZY
AND
DO
MISCHIEF
AND
SPEND
VICTUALS
AND
BE
QUICKLY
WEARY
AND
THEN
CERTIFY
OVER
TO
THEIR
COUNTRY
TO
THE
DISCREDIT
OF
THE
PLANTATION
THE
PEOPLE
WHEREWITH
YOU
PLANT
OUGHT
TO
BE
GARDENERS
PLOUGHMEN
LABORERS
SMITHS
CARPENTERS
JOINERS
FISHERMEN
FOWLERS
WITH
SOME
FEW
APOTHECARIES
SURGEONS
COOKS
AND
BAKERS
IN
COUNTRY
OF
PLANTATION
FIRST
LOOK
ABOUT
WHAT
KIND
OF
VICTUAL
THE
COUNTRY
YIELDS
OF
ITSELF
TO
HAND
AS
CHESTNUTS
WALNUTS
PINEAPPLES
OLIVES
DATES
PLUMS
CHERRIES
WILD
HONEY
AND
THE
LIKE
AND
MAKE
USE
OF
THEM
THEN
CONSIDER
WHAT
VICTUAL
OR
ESCULENT
THINGS
THERE
ARE
WHICH
GROW
SPEEDILY
AND
WITHIN
THE
YEAR
AS
PARSNIPS
CARROTS
TURNIPS
ONIONS
RADISH
ARTICHOKES
OF
HIERUSALEM
MAIZE
AND
THE
LIKE
FOR
WHEAT
BARLEY
AND
OATS
THEY
ASK
TOO
MUCH
LABOR
BUT
WITH
PEASE
AND
BEANS
YOU
MAY
BEGIN
BOTH
BECAUSE
THEY
ASK
LESS
LABOR
AND
BECAUSE
THEY
SERVE
FOR
MEAT
AS
WELL
AS
FOR
BREAD
AND
OF
RICE
LIKEWISE
COMETH
GREAT
INCREASE
AND
IT
IS
KIND
OF
MEAT
ABOVE
ALL
THERE
OUGHT
TO
BE
BROUGHT

OF

OAT
MEAL
FLOUR
MEAL
AND
THE
LIKE
IN
THE

TILL
BREAD
MAY
BE
HAD
FOR

OR

TAKE
CHIEFLY
SUCH
AS
ARE
LEAST
SUBJECT
TO
DISEASES
AND
MULTIPLY
FASTEST
AS
SWINE
GOATS
COCKS
HENS
TURKEYS
GEESE
HOUSE
DOVES
AND
THE
LIKE
THE
VICTUAL
IN
PLANTATIONS
OUGHT
TO
BE
EXPENDED
ALMOST
AS
IN
BESIEGED
TOWN
THAT
IS
WITH
CERTAIN
ALLOWANCE
AND
LET
THE
MAIN
PART
OF
THE
GROUND
EMPLOYED
TO
GARDENS
OR
CORN
BE
TO
COMMON
STOCK
AND
TO
BE
LAID
IN
AND
STORED
UP
AND
THEN
DELIVERED
OUT
IN
PROPORTION
BESIDES
SOME
SPOTS
OF
GROUND
THAT
ANY
PARTICULAR
PERSON
WILL
MANURE
FOR
HIS
OWN
PRIVATE
CONSIDER
LIKEWISE
WHAT
COMMODITIES
THE
SOIL
WHERE
THE
PLANTATION
IS
DOTH
NATURALLY
YIELD
THAT
THEY
MAY
SOME
WAY
HELP
TO
DEFRAY
THE
CHARGE
OF
THE
PLANTATION
SO
IT
BE
NOT
AS
WAS
SAID
TO
THE
UNTIMELY
PREJUDICE
OF
THE
MAIN
BUSINESS
AS
IT
HATH
FARED
WITH
TOBACCO
IN
VIRGINIA
WOOD
COMMONLY
ABOUNDETH
BUT
TOO
MUCH
AND
THEREFORE
TIMBER
IS
FIT
TO
BE
ONE
IF
THERE
BE
IRON
ORE
AND
STREAMS
WHEREUPON
TO
SET
THE
MILLS
IRON
IS
BRAVE
COMMODITY
WHERE

ABOUNDETH
MAKING
OF

SALT
IF
THE

BE
PROPER
FOR
IT
WOULD
BE
PUT
IN
EXPERIENCE
GROWING
SILK
LIKEWISE
IF
ANY

IS
LIKELY
COMMODITY
PITCH
AND
TAR
WHERE

NOT

WHERE
THEY
ARE

BUT
YIELD
GREAT
PROFIT
SOAP
ASHES
LIKEWISE
AND
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
MAY
BE
THOUGHT
OF
BUT
MOIL
NOT
TOO
MUCH
UNDER
GROUND
FOR
THE
HOPE
OF
MINES
IS
VERY
UNCERTAIN
AND
USETH
TO
MAKE
THE
PLANTERS
LAZY
IN
OTHER
THINGS
FOR
GOVERNMENT
LET
IT
BE
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
ONE
ASSISTED
WITH
SOME
COUNSEL
AND
LET
THEM
HAVE
COMMISSION
TO
EXERCISE
MARTIAL
LAWS
WITH
SOME
LIMITATION
AND
ABOVE
ALL
LET
MEN
MAKE
THAT
PROFIT
OF
BEING
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
AS
THEY
HAVE
GOD
ALWAYS
AND
HIS
SERVICE
BEFORE
THEIR
EYES
LET
NOT
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
THE
PLANTATION
DEPEND
UPON
TOO
MANY
COUNSELLORS
AND
UNDERTAKERS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
THAT
PLANTETH
BUT
UPON
TEMPERATE
NUMBER
AND
LET
THOSE
BE
RATHER
NOBLEMEN
AND
GENTLEMEN
THAN
MERCHANTS
FOR
THEY
LOOK
EVER
TO
THE
PRESENT
GAIN
LET
THERE
BE
FREEDOM
FROM
CUSTOM
TILL
THE

BE
OF
STRENGTH
AND
NOT
ONLY
FREEDOM
FROM
CUSTOM
BUT
FREEDOM
TO
CARRY
THEIR
COMMODITIES
WHERE
THEY
MAY
MAKE
THEIR
BEST
OF
THEM
EXCEPT
THERE
BE
SOME
SPECIAL
CAUSE
OF
CAUTION
CRAM
NOT
IN
PEOPLE
BY
SENDING
TOO
FAST
COMPANY
AFTER
COMPANY
BUT
RATHER
HARKEN
HOW
THEY
WASTE
AND
SEND
SUPPLIES
PROPORTIONABLY
BUT
SO
AS
THE
NUMBER
MAY
LIVE
WELL
IN
THE
PLANTATION
AND
NOT
BY
SURCHARGE
BE
IN
PENURY
IT
HATH
BEEN
GREAT
ENDANGERING
TO
THE
HEALTH
OF
SOME
PLANTATIONS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
BUILT
ALONG
THE
SEA
AND
RIVERS
IN
MARISH
AND
UNWHOLESOME
GROUNDS
THEREFORE
THOUGH
YOU
BEGIN
THERE
TO
AVOID
CARRIAGE
AND
LIKE
DISCOMMODITIES
YET
BUILD
STILL
RATHER
UPWARDS
FROM
THE
STREAMS
THAN
ALONG
IT
CONCERNETH
LIKEWISE
THE
HEALTH
OF
THE
PLANTATION
THAT
THEY
HAVE
GOOD
STORE
OF
SALT
WITH
THEM
THAT
THEY
MAY
USE
IT
IN
THEIR
VICTUALS
WHEN
IT
SHALL
BE
NECESSARY
IF
YOU
PLANT
WHERE
SAVAGES
ARE
DO
NOT
ONLY
ENTERTAIN
THEM
WITH
TRIFLES
AND
GINGLES
BUT
USE
THEM
JUSTLY
AND
GRACIOUSLY
WITH
SUFFICIENT
GUARD
NEVERTHELESS
AND
DO
NOT
WIN
THEIR
FAVOR
BY
HELPING
THEM
TO
INVADE
THEIR
ENEMIES
BUT
FOR
THEIR
DEFENCE
IT
IS
NOT
AMISS
AND
SEND
OFT
OF
THEM
OVER
TO
THE
COUNTRY
THAT
PLANTS
THAT
THEY
MAY
SEE
BETTER
CONDITION
THAN
THEIR
OWN
AND
COMMEND
IT
WHEN
THEY
RETURN
WHEN
THE
PLANTATION
GROWS
TO
STRENGTH
THEN
IT
IS
TIME
TO
PLANT
WITH
WOMEN
AS
WELL
AS
WITH
MEN
THAT
THE
PLANTATION
MAY
SPREAD
INTO
GENERATIONS
AND
NOT
BE
EVER
PIECED
FROM
WITHOUT
IT
IS
THE
SINFULLEST
THING
IN
THE
WORLD
TO
FORSAKE
OR
DESTITUTE
PLANTATION
ONCE
IN
FORWARDNESS
FOR
BESIDES
THE
DISHONOR
IT
IS
THE
GUILTINESS
OF
BLOOD
OF
MANY
COMMISERABLE
PERSONS
OF
RICHES
CANNOT
CALL
RICHES
BETTER
THAN
THE
BAGGAGE
OF
VIRTUE
THE
ROMAN
WORD
IS
BETTER
IMPEDIMENTA
FOR
AS
THE
BAGGAGE
IS
TO
AN
ARMY
SO
IS
RICHES
TO
VIRTUE
IT
CANNOT
BE
SPARED
NOR
LEFT
BEHIND
BUT
IT
HINDERETH
THE
MARCH
YEA
AND
THE
CARE
OF
IT
SOMETIMES
LOSETH
OR
DISTURBETH
THE
VICTORY
OF
GREAT
RICHES
THERE
IS
NO
REAL
USE
EXCEPT
IT
BE
IN
THE

THE

IS
BUT
CONCEIT
SO
SAITH
SOLOMON
WHERE
MUCH
IS
THERE
ARE
MANY
TO
CONSUME
IT
AND
WHAT
HATH
THE

BUT
THE
SIGHT
OF
IT
WITH
HIS

THE
PERSONAL
FRUITION
IN
ANY
MAN
CANNOT
REACH
TO

GREAT
RICHES
THERE
IS
CUSTODY
OF

OR
POWER
OF
DOLE
AND
DONATIVE
OF

OR
FAME
OF

BUT
NO
SOLID
USE
TO
THE

DO
YOU
NOT
SEE
WHAT
FEIGNED
PRICES
ARE
SET
UPON
LITTLE
STONES
AND
RARITIES
AND
WHAT
WORKS
OF
OSTENTATION
ARE
UNDERTAKEN
BECAUSE
THERE
MIGHT
SEEM
TO
BE
SOME
USE
OF
GREAT
RICHES
BUT
THEN
YOU
WILL
SAY
THEY
MAY
BE
OF

TO

OR

AS
SOLOMON
SAITH
RICHES
ARE
AS

IN
THE

THIS
IS
EXCELLENTLY
EXPRESSED
THAT
IT
IS
IN

AND
NOT

IN

FOR
CERTAINLY
GREAT

HAVE
SOLD
MORE

THINGS
CHIEFLY
BY

AND
BY
GOOD

FOR

BUT
THE

ARE

CUNNINGLY
THAT

OF

WERE
HENRY

PHILIP

ENGLAND
SHOULD

CONFUSION

THANKS

ONLY
IN
THE

OF

FOR
THAT
THE

STYLE
IS
NOW
NO

OF

OF

THERE
WAS
ALSO
ANOTHER

BEFORE
THE

OF
WHICH
DO
NOT

UNDERSTAND
THERE
SHALL
BE
SEEN
UPON

BETWEEN
THE

THE
BLACK
FLEET
OF

WHEN
THAT
THAT
IS
COME

GONE
ENGLAND
BUILD
HOUSES
OF
LIME
AND
STONE
FOR
AFTER

SHALL
YOU
HAVE
NONE
IT
WAS
GENERALLY
CONCEIVED
TO
BE
MEANT
OF
THE
SPANISH
FLEET
THAT
CAME
IN
FOR
THAT
THE
KING
OF
SPAIN
SURNAME
AS
THEY
SAY
IS
NORWAY
THE
PREDICTION
OF
REGIOMONTANUS
OCTOGESIMUS
OCTAVUS
MIRABILIS
ANNUS
WAS
THOUGHT
LIKEWISE
ACCOMPLISHED
IN
THE
SENDING
OF
THAT
GREAT
FLEET
BEING
THE
GREATEST
IN
STRENGTH
THOUGH
NOT
IN
NUMBER
OF
ALL
THAT
EVER
SWAM
UPON
THE
SEA
AS
FOR
CLEON
DREAM
THINK
IT
WAS
JEST
IT
WAS
THAT
HE
WAS
DEVOURED
OF
LONG
DRAGON
AND
IT
WAS
EXPOUNDED
OF
MAKER
OF
SAUSAGES
THAT
TROUBLED
HIM
EXCEEDINGLY
THERE
ARE
NUMBERS
OF
THE
LIKE
KIND
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
INCLUDE
DREAMS
AND
PREDICTIONS
OF
ASTROLOGY
BUT
HAVE
SET
DOWN
THESE
FEW
ONLY
OF
CERTAIN
CREDIT
FOR
EXAMPLE
MY
JUDGMENT
IS
THAT
THEY
OUGHT
ALL
TO
BE
DESPISED
AND
OUGHT
TO
SERVE
BUT
FOR
WINTER
TALK
BY
THE
FIRESIDE
THOUGH
WHEN
SAY
DESPISED
MEAN
IT
AS
FOR
BELIEF
FOR
OTHERWISE
THE
SPREADING
OR
PUBLISHING
OF
THEM
IS
IN
NO
SORT
TO
BE
DESPISED
FOR
THEY
HAVE
DONE
MUCH
MISCHIEF
AND
SEE
MANY
SEVERE
LAWS
MADE
TO
SUPPRESS
THEM
THAT
THAT
HATH
GIVEN
THEM
GRACE
AND
SOME
CREDIT
CONSISTETH
IN
THREE
THINGS
FIRST
THAT
MEN
MARK
WHEN
THEY
HIT
AND
NEVER
MARK
WHEN
THEY
MISS
AS
THEY
DO
GENERALLY
ALSO
OF
DREAMS
THE
SECOND
IS
THAT
PROBABLE
CONJECTURES
OR
OBSCURE
TRADITIONS
MANY
TIMES
TURN
THEMSELVES
INTO
PROPHECIES
WHILE
THE
NATURE
OF
MAN
WHICH
COVETETH
DIVINATION
THINKS
IT
NO
PERIL
TO
FORETELL
THAT
WHICH
INDEED
THEY
DO
BUT
COLLECT
AS
THAT
OF
SENECA
VERSE
FOR
SO
MUCH
WAS
THEN
SUBJECT
TO
DEMONSTRATION
THAT
THE
GLOBE
OF
THE
EARTH
HAD
GREAT
PARTS
BEYOND
THE
ATLANTIC
WHICH
MOUGHT
BE
PROBABLY
CONCEIVED
NOT
TO
BE
ALL
SEA
AND
ADDING
THERETO
THE
TRADITION
IN
PLATO
TIMAEUS
AND
HIS
ATLANTICUS
IT
MOUGHT
ENCOURAGE
ONE
TO
TURN
IT
TO
PREDICTION
THE
THIRD
AND
LAST
WHICH
IS
THE
GREAT
ONE
IS
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THEM
BEING
INFINITE
IN
NUMBER
HAVE
BEEN
IMPOSTURES
AND
BY
IDLE
AND
CRAFTY
BRAINS
MERELY
CONTRIVED
AND
FEIGNED
AFTER
THE
EVENT
PAST
OF
AMBITION
AMBITION
IS
LIKE
CHOLER
WHICH
IS
AN
HUMOR
THAT
MAKETH
MEN
ACTIVE
EARNEST
FULL
OF
ALACRITY
AND
STIRRING
IF
IT
BE
NOT
STOPPED
BUT
IF
IT
BE
STOPPED
AND
CANNOT
HAVE
HIS
WAY
IT
BECOMETH
ADUST
AND
THEREBY
MALIGN
AND
VENOMOUS
SO
AMBITIOUS
MEN
IF
THEY
FIND
THE
WAY
OPEN
FOR
THEIR
RISING
AND
STILL
GET
FORWARD
THEY
ARE
RATHER
BUSY
THAN
DANGEROUS
BUT
IF
THEY
BE
CHECKED
IN
THEIR
DESIRES
THEY
BECOME
SECRETLY
DISCONTENT
AND
LOOK
UPON
MEN
AND
MATTERS
WITH
AN
EVIL
EYE
AND
ARE
BEST
PLEASED
WHEN
THINGS
GO
BACKWARD
WHICH
IS
THE
WORST
PROPERTY
IN
SERVANT
OF
PRINCE
OR
STATE
THEREFORE
IT
IS
GOOD
FOR
PRINCES
IF
THEY
USE
AMBITIOUS
MEN
TO
HANDLE
IT
SO
AS
THEY
BE
STILL
PROGRESSIVE
AND
NOT
RETROGRADE
WHICH
BECAUSE
IT
CANNOT
BE
WITHOUT
INCONVENIENCE
IT
IS
GOOD
NOT
TO
USE
SUCH
NATURES
AT
ALL
FOR
IF
THEY
RISE
NOT
WITH
THEIR
SERVICE
THEY
WILL
TAKE
ORDER
TO
MAKE
THEIR
SERVICE
FALL
WITH
THEM
BUT
SINCE
WE
HAVE
SAID
IT
WERE
GOOD
NOT
TO
USE
MEN
OF
AMBITIOUS
NATURES
EXCEPT
IT
BE
UPON
NECESSITY
IT
IS
FIT
WE
SPEAK
IN
WHAT
CASES
THEY
ARE
OF
NECESSITY
GOOD
COMMANDERS
IN
THE
WARS
MUST
BE
TAKEN
BE
THEY
NEVER
SO
AMBITIOUS
FOR
THE
USE
OF
THEIR
SERVICE
DISPENSETH
WITH
THE
REST
AND
TO
TAKE
SOLDIER
WITHOUT
AMBITION
IS
TO
PULL
OFF
HIS
SPURS
THERE
IS
ALSO
GREAT
USE
OF
AMBITIOUS
MEN
IN
BEING
SCREENS
TO
PRINCES
IN
MATTERS
OF
DANGER
AND
ENVY
FOR
NO
MAN
WILL
TAKE
THAT
PART
EXCEPT
HE
BE
LIKE
SEELED
DOVE
THAT
MOUNTS
AND
MOUNTS
BECAUSE
HE
CANNOT
SEE
ABOUT
HIM
THERE
IS
USE
ALSO
OF
AMBITIOUS
MEN
IN
PULLING
DOWN
THE
GREATNESS
OF
ANY
SUBJECT
THAT
OVERTOPS
AS
TIBERIUS
USED
MARCO
IN
THE
PULLING
DOWN
OF
SEJANUS
SINCE
THEREFORE
THEY
MUST
BE
USED
IN
SUCH
CASES
THERE
RESTETH
TO
SPEAK
HOW
THEY
ARE
TO
BE
BRIDLED
THAT
THEY
MAY
BE
LESS
DANGEROUS
THERE
IS
LESS
DANGER
OF
THEM
IF
THEY
BE
OF
MEAN
BIRTH
THAN
IF
THEY
BE
NOBLE
AND
IF
THEY
BE
RATHER
HARSH
OF
NATURE
THAN
GRACIOUS
AND
POPULAR
AND
IF
THEY
BE
RATHER
NEW
RAISED
THAN
GROWN
CUNNING
AND
FORTIFIED
IN
THEIR
GREATNESS
IT
IS
COUNTED
BY
SOME
WEAKNESS
IN
PRINCES
TO
HAVE
FAVORITES
BUT
IT
IS
OF
ALL
OTHERS
THE
BEST
REMEDY
AGAINST
AMBITIOUS
GREAT
ONES
FOR
WHEN
THE
WAY
OF
PLEASURING
AND
DISPLEASURING
LIETH
BY
THE
FAVORITE
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
ANY
OTHER
SHOULD
BE
OVERGREAT
ANOTHER
MEANS
TO
CURB
THEM
IS
TO
BALANCE
THEM
BY
OTHERS
AS
PROUD
AS
THEY
BUT
THEN
THERE
MUST
BE
SOME
MIDDLE
COUNSELLORS
TO
KEEP
THINGS
STEADY
FOR
WITHOUT
THAT
BALLAST
THE
SHIP
WILL
ROLL
TOO
MUCH
AT
THE
LEAST
PRINCE
MAY
ANIMATE
AND
INURE
SOME
MEANER
PERSONS
TO
BE
AS
IT
WERE
SCOURGES
TO
AMBITIOUS
MEN
AS
FOR
THE
HAVING
OF
THEM
OBNOXIOUS
TO
RUIN
IF
THEY
BE
OF
FEARFUL
NATURES
IT
MAY
DO
WELL
BUT
IF
THEY
BE
STOUT
AND
DARING
IT
MAY
PRECIPITATE
THEIR
DESIGNS
AND
PROVE
DANGEROUS
AS
FOR
THE
PULLING
OF
THEM
DOWN
IF
THE
AFFAIRS
REQUIRE
IT
AND
THAT
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
DONE
WITH
SAFETY
SUDDENLY
THE
ONLY
WAY
IS
THE
INTERCHANGE
CONTINUALLY
OF
FAVORS
AND
DISGRACES
WHEREBY
THEY
MAY
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
EXPECT
AND
BE
AS
IT
WERE
IN
WOOD
OF
AMBITIONS
IT
IS
LESS
HARMFUL
THE
AMBITION
TO
PREVAIL
IN
GREAT
THINGS
THAN
THAT
OTHER
TO
APPEAR
IN
EVERY
THING
FOR
THAT
BREEDS
CONFUSION
AND
MARS
BUSINESS
BUT
YET
IT
IS
LESS
DANGER
TO
HAVE
AN
AMBITIOUS
MAN
STIRRING
IN
BUSINESS
THAN
GREAT
IN
DEPENDENCES
HE
THAT
SEEKETH
TO
BE
EMINENT
AMONGST
ABLE
MEN
HATH
GREAT
TASK
BUT
THAT
IS
EVER
GOOD
FOR
THE
PUBLIC
BUT
HE
THAT
PLOTS
TO
BE
THE
ONLY
FIGURE
AMONGST
CIPHERS
IS
THE
DECAY
OF

AGE
HONOR
HATH
THREE
THINGS
IN
IT
THE
VANTAGE
GROUND
TO
DO
GOOD
THE
APPROACH

AND
THE

FORTUNES
HE
THAT
HATH
THE
BEST
OF
THESE
INTENTIONS
WHEN
HE
ASPIRETH
IS
AN
HONEST
MAN
AND
THAT
PRINCE
THAT
CAN
DISCERN
OF
THESE
INTENTIONS
IN
ANOTHER
THAT
ASPIRETH
IS
WISE
PRINCE
GENERALLY
LET
PRINCES
AND
STATES
CHOOSE
SUCH
MINISTERS
AS
ARE
MORE
SENSIBLE
OF
DUTY
THAN
OF
USING
AND
SUCH
AS
LOVE
BUSINESS
RATHER
UPON
CONSCIENCE
THAN
UPON
BRAVERY
AND
LET
THEM
DISCERN
BUSY
NATURE
FROM
WILLING
MIND
OF
MASQUES
AND
TRIUMPHS
THESE
THINGS
ARE
BUT
TOYS
TO
COME
AMONGST
SUCH
SERIOUS
OBSERVATIONS
BUT
YET
SINCE
PRINCES
WILL
HAVE
SUCH
THINGS
IT
IS
BETTER
THEY
SHOULD
BE
GRACED
WITH
ELEGANCY
THAN
DAUBED
WITH
COST
DANCING
TO
SONG
IS
THING
OF
GREAT
STATE
AND
PLEASURE
UNDERSTAND
IT
THAT
THE
SONG
BE
IN
QUIRE
PLACED
ALOFT
AND
ACCOMPANIED
WITH
SOME
BROKEN
MUSIC
AND
THE
DITTY
FITTED
TO
THE

ACTING
IN

ESPECIALLY
IN
DIALOGUES
HATH
AN
EXTREME
GOOD
GRACE
SAY
ACTING
NOT
DANCING
FOR
THAT
IS
MEAN
AND
VULGAR
THING
AND
THE
VOICES
OF
THE
DIALOGUE
WOULD
BE
STRONG
AND
MANLY
BASE
AND
TENOR
NO
TREBLE
AND
THE

HIGH
AND
TRAGICAL
NOT
NICE
OR
DAINTY
SEVERAL
QUIRES
PLACED

OVER
AGAINST

AND
TAKING
THE
VOICE
BY
CATCHES
ANTHEM
WISE
GIVE
GREAT
PLEASURE
TURNING
DANCES
INTO

IS
CHILDISH
CURIOSITY
AND
GENERALLY
LET
IT
BE
NOTED
THAT
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
HERE
SET
DOWN
ARE
SUCH
AS
DO
NATURALLY
TAKE
THE
SENSE
AND
NOT

PETTY
WONDERMENTS
IT
IS
TRUE
THE
ALTERATIONS
OF

SO
IT
BE
QUIETLY
AND
WITHOUT

ARE
THINGS
OF
GREAT
BEAUTY
AND
PLEASURE
FOR
THEY
FEED
AND
RELIEVE
THE
EYE
BEFORE
IT
BE
FULL
OF
THE
SAME
OBJECT
LET
THE
SCENES
ABOUND
WITH
LIGHT
SPECIALLY
COLORED
AND
VARIED
AND
LET
THE
MASQUERS
OR
ANY
OTHER
THAT
ARE
TO
COME
DOWN
FROM
THE
SCENE
HAVE
SOME
MOTIONS
UPON
THE
SCENE
ITSELF
BEFORE
THEIR
COMING
DOWN
FOR
IT
DRAWS
THE
EYE
STRANGELY
AND
MAKES
IT
WITH
GREAT
PLEASURE
TO
DESIRE
TO
SEE
THAT
IT
CANNOT
PERFECTLY
DISCERN
LET
THE
SONGS
BE
LOUD
AND
CHEERFUL
AND
NOT
CHIRPINGS
OR

LET
THE
MUSIC
LIKEWISE
BE
SHARP
AND
LOUD
AND
WELL
PLACED
THE
COLORS
THAT
SHOW
BEST
BY

ARE
WHITE
CARNATION
AND
KIND
OF

WATER
GREEN

OES
OR

AS
THEY
ARE
OF
NO
GREAT
COST
SO
THEY
ARE
OF

GLORY
AS
FOR

EMBROIDERY
IT
IS
LOST
AND
NOT

LET
THE
SUITS
OF
THE

BE

AND

AS

WHEN
THE
VIZORS
ARE
OFF
NOT

THAT
IS

AS

IS

HIS
NATURE
LET
HIM
NOT
SET
HIMSELF
TOO
GREAT
NOR
TOO
SMALL
TASKS
FOR
THE
FIRST
WILL
MAKE
HIM
DEJECTED
BY
OFTEN
FAILINGS
AND
THE
SECOND
WILL
MAKE
HIM
SMALL
PROCEEDER
THOUGH
BY
OFTEN
PREVAILINGS
AND
AT
THE
FIRST
LET
HIM
PRACTISE
WITH
HELPS
AS
SWIMMERS
DO
WITH
BLADDERS
OR
RUSHES
BUT
AFTER
TIME
LET
HIM
PRACTISE
WITH
DISADVANTAGES
AS
DANCERS
DO
WITH
THICK
SHOES
FOR
IT
BREEDS
GREAT
PERFECTION
IF
THE
PRACTICE
BE
HARDER
THAN
THE
USE
WHERE
NATURE
IS
MIGHTY
AND
THEREFORE
THE
VICTORY
HARD
THE
DEGREES
HAD
NEED
BE
FIRST
TO
STAY
AND
ARREST
NATURE
IN
TIME
LIKE
TO
HIM
THAT
WOULD
SAY
OVER
THE
FOUR
AND
TWENTY
LETTERS
WHEN
HE
WAS
ANGRY
THEN
TO
GO
LESS
IN
QUANTITY
AS
IF
ONE
SHOULD
IN
FORBEARING
WINE
COME
FROM
DRINKING
HEALTHS
TO
DRAUGHT
AT
MEAL
AND
LASTLY
TO
DISCONTINUE
ALTOGETHER
BUT
IF
MAN
HAVE
THE
FORTITUDE
AND
RESOLUTION
TO
ENFRANCHISE
HIMSELF
AT
ONCE
THAT
IS
THE
BEST
OPTIMUS
ILLE
ANIMI
VINDEX
LAEDENTIA
PECTUS
VINCULA
QUI
RUPIT
DEDOLUITQUE
SEMEL
NEITHER
IS
THE
ANCIENT
RULE
AMISS
TO
BEND
NATURE
AS
WAND
TO
CONTRARY
EXTREME
WHEREBY
TO
SET
IT
RIGHT
UNDERSTANDING
IT
WHERE
THE
CONTRARY
EXTREME
IS
NO
VICE
LET
NOT
MAN
FORCE
HABIT
UPON
HIMSELF
WITH
PERPETUAL
CONTINUANCE
BUT
WITH
SOME
INTERMISSION
FOR
BOTH
THE
PAUSE
REINFORCETH
THE
NEW
ONSET
AND
IF
MAN
THAT
IS
NOT
PERFECT
BE
EVER
IN
PRACTICE
HE
SHALL
AS
WELL
PRACTISE
HIS
ERRORS
AS
HIS
ABILITIES
AND
INDUCE
ONE
HABIT
OF
BOTH
AND
THERE
IS
NO
MEANS
TO
HELP
THIS
BUT
BY
SEASONABLE
INTERMISSIONS
BUT
LET
NOT
MAN
TRUST
HIS
VICTORY
OVER
HIS
NATURE
TOO
FAR
FOR
NATURE
WILL
LAY
BURIED
GREAT
TIME
AND
YET
REVIVE
UPON
THE
OCCASION
OR
TEMPTATION
LIKE
AS
IT
WAS
WITH
AESOP
DAMSEL
TURNED
FROM
CAT
TO
WOMAN
WHO
SAT
VERY
DEMURELY
AT
THE
BOARD
END
TILL
MOUSE
RAN
BEFORE
HER
THEREFORE
LET
MAN
EITHER
AVOID
THE
OCCASION
ALTOGETHER
OR
PUT
HIMSELF
OFTEN
TO
IT
THAT
HE
MAY
BE
LITTLE
MOVED
WITH
IT
MAN
NATURE
IS
BEST
PERCEIVED
IN
PRIVATENESS
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
AFFECTATION
IN

FOR
THAT
PUTTETH
MAN
OUT
OF
HIS
PRECEPTS
AND
IN
NEW
CASE
OR
EXPERIMENT
FOR
THERE
CUSTOM
LEAVETH
HIM
THEY
ARE
HAPPY
MEN
WHOSE
NATURES
SORT
WITH
THEIR
VOCATIONS
OTHERWISE
THEY
MAY
SAY
MULTUM
INCOLA
FUIT
ANIMA
MEA
WHEN
THEY
CONVERSE
IN
THOSE
THINGS
THEY
DO
NOT
AFFECT
IN
STUDIES
WHATSOEVER
MAN
COMMANDETH
UPON
HIMSELF
LET
HIM
SET
HOURS
FOR
IT
BUT
WHATSOEVER
IS
AGREEABLE
TO
HIS
NATURE
LET
HIM
TAKE
NO
CARE
FOR
ANY
SET
TIMES
FOR
HIS
THOUGHTS
WILL
FLY
TO
IT
OF
THEMSELVES
SO
AS
THE
SPACES
OF
OTHER
BUSINESS
OR
STUDIES
WILL
SUFFICE
MAN
NATURE
RUNS
EITHER
TO
HERBS
OR
WEEDS
THEREFORE
LET
HIM
SEASONABLY
WATER
THE
ONE
AND
DESTROY
THE
OTHER
OF
CUSTOM
AND
EDUCATION
MEN
THOUGHTS
ARE
MUCH
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
INCLINATION
THEIR
DISCOURSE
AND
SPEECHES
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
LEARNING
AND
INFUSED
OPINIONS
BUT
THEIR
DEEDS
ARE
AFTER
AS
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
ACCUSTOMED
AND
THEREFORE
AS
MACHIAVEL
WELL
NOTETH
THOUGH
IN
AN
EVIL
FAVORED
INSTANCE
THERE
IS
NO
TRUSTING
TO
THE
FORCE
OF
NATURE
NOR
TO
THE
BRAVERY
OF
WORDS
EXCEPT
IT
BE
CORROBORATE
BY
CUSTOM
HIS
INSTANCE
IS
THAT
FOR
THE
ACHIEVING
OF
DESPERATE
CONSPIRACY
MAN
SHOULD
NOT
REST
UPON
THE
FIERCENESS
OF
ANY
MAN
NATURE
OR
HIS
RESOLUTE
UNDERTAKINGS
BUT
TAKE
SUCH
AN
ONE
AS
HATH
HAD
HIS
HANDS
FORMERLY
IN
BLOOD
BUT
MACHIAVEL
KNEW
NOT
OF
FRIAR
CLEMENT
NOR
RAVILLAC
NOR
JAUREGUY
NOR
BALTAZAR
GERARD
YET
HIS
RULE
HOLDETH
STILL
THAT
NATURE
NOR
THE
ENGAGEMENT
OF
WORDS
ARE
NOT
SO
FORCIBLE
AS
CUSTOM
ONLY
SUPERSTITION
IS
NOW
SO
WELL
ADVANCED
THAT
MEN
OF
THE
FIRST
BLOOD
ARE
AS
FIRM
AS
BUTCHERS
BY
OCCUPATION
AND
VOTARY
RESOLUTION
IS
MADE
EQUIPOLLENT
TO
CUSTOM
EVEN
IN
MATTER
OF
BLOOD
IN
OTHER
THINGS
THE
PREDOMINANCY
OF
CUSTOM
IS
EVERYWHERE
VISIBLE
INSOMUCH
AS
MAN
WOULD
WONDER
TO
HEAR
MEN
PROFESS
PROTEST
ENGAGE
GIVE
GREAT
WORDS
AND
THEN
DO
JUST
AS
THEY
HAVE
DONE
BEFORE
AS
IF
THEY
WERE
DEAD
IMAGES
AND
ENGINES
MOVED
ONLY
BY
THE
WHEELS
OF
CUSTOM
WE
SEE
ALSO
THE
REIGN
OR
TYRANNY
OF
CUSTOM
WHAT
IT
IS
THE
INDIANS
MEAN
THE
SECT
OF
THEIR
WISE
MEN
LAY
THEMSELVES
QUIETLY
UPON
STOCK
OF
WOOD
AND
SO
SACRIFICE
THEMSELVES
BY
FIRE
NAY
THE
WIVES
STRIVE
TO
BE
BURNED
WITH
THE
CORPSES
OF
THEIR
HUSBANDS
THE
LADS
OF
SPARTA
OF
ANCIENT
TIME
WERE
WONT
TO
BE
SCOURGED
UPON
THE
ALTAR
OF
DIANA
WITHOUT
SO
MUCH
AS
QUECHING
REMEMBER
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
TIME
OF
ENGLAND
AN
IRISH
REBEL
CONDEMNED
PUT
UP
PETITION
TO
THE
DEPUTY
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
HANGED
IN
WITHE
AND
NOT
IN
AN
HALTER
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
BEEN
SO
USED
WITH
FORMER
REBELS
THERE
BE
MONKS
IN
RUSSIA
FOR
PENANCE
THAT
WILL
SIT
WHOLE
NIGHT
IN
VESSEL
OF
WATER
TILL
THEY
BE
ENGAGED
WITH
HARD
ICE
MANY
EXAMPLES
MAY
BE
PUT
OF
THE
FORCE
OF
CUSTOM
BOTH
UPON
MIND
AND
BODY
THEREFORE
SINCE
CUSTOM
IS
THE
PRINCIPAL
MAGISTRATE
OF
MAN
LIFE
LET
MEN
BY
ALL
MEANS
ENDEAVOR
TO
OBTAIN
GOOD
CUSTOMS
CERTAINLY
CUSTOM
IS
MOST
PERFECT
WHEN
IT
BEGINNETH
IN
YOUNG
YEARS
THIS
WE
CALL
EDUCATION
WHICH
IS
IN
EFFECT
BUT
AN
EARLY
CUSTOM
SO
WE
SEE
IN
LANGUAGES
THE
TONGUE
IS
MORE
PLIANT
TO
ALL
EXPRESSIONS
AND
SOUNDS
THE
JOINTS
ARE
MORE
SUPPLE
TO
ALL
FEATS
OF
ACTIVITY
AND
MOTIONS
IN
YOUTH
THAN
AFTERWARDS
FOR
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
LATE
LEARNERS
CANNOT
SO
WELL
TAKE
THE
PLY
EXCEPT
IT
BE
IN
SOME
MINDS
THAT
HAVE
NOT
SUFFERED
THEMSELVES
TO
FIX
BUT
HAVE
KEPT
THEMSELVES
OPEN
AND
PREPARED
TO
RECEIVE
CONTINUAL
AMENDMENT
WHICH
IS
EXCEEDING
RARE
BUT
IF
THE
FORCE
OF
CUSTOM
SIMPLE
AND
SEPARATE
BE
GREAT
THE
FORCE
OF
CUSTOM
COPULATE
AND
CONJOINED
AND
COLLEGIATE
IS
FAR
GREATER
FOR
THERE
EXAMPLE
TEACHETH
COMPANY
COMFORTETH
EMULATION
QUICKENETH
GLORY
RAISETH
SO
AS
IN
SUCH
PLACES
THE
FORCE
OF
CUSTOM
IS
IN
HIS
EXALTATION
CERTAINLY
THE
GREAT
MULTIPLICATION
OF
VIRTUES
UPON
HUMAN
NATURE
RESTETH
UPON
SOCIETIES
WELL
ORDAINED
AND
DISCIPLINED
FOR
COMMONWEALTHS
AND
GOOD
GOVERNMENTS
DO
NOURISH
VIRTUE
GROWN
BUT
DO
NOT
MUCH
MEND
THE
DEEDS
BUT
THE
MISERY
IS
THAT
THE
MOST
EFFECTUAL
MEANS
ARE
NOW
APPLIED
TO
THE
ENDS
LEAST
TO
BE
DESIRED
OF
FORTUNE
IT
CANNOT
BE
DENIED
BUT
OUTWARD
ACCIDENTS
CONDUCE
MUCH
TO
FORTUNE
FAVOR
OPPORTUNITY
DEATH
OF
OTHERS
OCCASION
FITTING
VIRTUE
BUT
CHIEFLY
THE
MOULD
OF
MAN
FORTUNE
IS
IN
HIS
OWN
HANDS
FABER
QUISQUE
FORTUNAE
SUAE
SAITH
THE
POET
AND
THE
MOST
FREQUENT
OF
EXTERNAL
CAUSES
IS
THAT
THE
FOLLY
OF
ONE
MAN
IS
THE
FORTUNE
OF
ANOTHER
FOR
NO
MAN
PROSPERS
SO
SUDDENLY
AS
BY
OTHERS
ERRORS
SERPENS
NISI
SERPENTEM
COMEDERIT
NON
FIT
DRACO
OVERT
AND
APPARENT
VIRTUES
BRING
FORTH
PRAISE
BUT
THERE
BE
SECRET
AND
HIDDEN
VIRTUES
THAT
BRING
FORTH
FORTUNE
CERTAIN
DELIVERIES
OF
MAN
SELF
WHICH
HAVE
NO
NAME
THE
SPANISH
NAME
DESEMBOLTURA
PARTLY
EXPRESSETH
THEM
WHEN
THERE
BE
NOT
STONDS
NOR
RESTIVENESS
IN
MAN
NATURE
BUT
THAT
THE
WHEELS
OF
HIS
MIND
KEEP
WAY
WITH
THE
WHEELS
OF
HIS
FORTUNE
FOR
SO
LIVY
AFTER
HE
HAD
DESCRIBED
CATO
MAJOR
IN
THESE
WORDS
IN
ILLO
VIRO
TANTUM
ROBUR
CORPORIS
ET
ANIMI
FUIT
UT
QUOCUNQUE
LOCO
NATUS
ESSET
FORTUNAM
SIBI
FACTURUS
VIDERETUR
FALLETH
UPON
THAT
THAT
HE
HAD
VERSATILE
INGENIUM
THEREFORE
IF
MAN
LOOK
SHARPLY
AND
ATTENTIVELY
HE
SHALL
SEE
FORTUNE
FOR
THOUGH
SHE
BE
BLIND
YET
SHE
IS
NOT
INVISIBLE
THE
WAY
OF
FORTUNE
IS
LIKE
THE
MILKEN
WAY
IN
THE
SKY
WHICH
IS
MEETING
OR
KNOT
OF
NUMBER
OF
SMALL
STARS
NOT
SEEN
ASUNDER
BUT
GIVING
LIGHT
TOGETHER
SO
ARE
THERE
NUMBER
OF
LITTLE
AND
SCARCE
DISCERNED
VIRTUES
OR
RATHER
FACULTIES
AND
CUSTOMS
THAT
MAKE
MEN
FORTUNATE
THE
ITALIANS
NOTE
SOME
OF
THEM
SUCH
AS
MAN
WOULD
LITTLE
THINK
WHEN
THEY
SPEAK
OF
ONE
THAT
CANNOT
DO
AMISS
THEY
WILL
THROW
IN
INTO
HIS
OTHER
CONDITIONS
THAT
HE
HATH
POCO
DI
MATTO
AND
CERTAINLY
THERE
BE
NOT
TWO
MORE
FORTUNATE
PROPERTIES
THAN
TO
HAVE
LITTLE
OF
THE
FOOL
AND
NOT
TOO
MUCH
OF
THE
HONEST
THEREFORE
EXTREME
LOVERS
OF
THEIR
COUNTRY
OR
MASTERS
WERE
NEVER
FORTUNATE
NEITHER
CAN
THEY
BE
FOR
WHEN
MAN
PLACETH
HIS
THOUGHTS
WITHOUT
HIMSELF
HE
GOETH
NOT
HIS
OWN
WAY
AN
HASTY
FORTUNE
MAKETH
AN
ENTERPRISER
AND
REMOVER
THE
FRENCH
HATH
IT
BETTER
ENTREPRENANT
OR
REMUANT
BUT
THE
EXERCISED
FORTUNE
MAKETH
THE
ABLE
MAN
FORTUNE
IS
TO
BE
HONORED
AND
RESPECTED
AND
IT
BE
BUT
FOR
HER
DAUGHTERS
CONFIDENCE
AND
REPUTATION
FOR
THOSE
TWO
FELICITY
BREEDETH
THE
FIRST
WITHIN
MAN
SELF
THE
LATTER
IN
OTHERS
TOWARDS
HIM
ALL
WISE
MEN
TO
DECLINE
THE
ENVY
OF
THEIR
OWN
VIRTUES
USE
TO
ASCRIBE
THEM
TO
PROVIDENCE
AND
FORTUNE
FOR
SO
THEY
MAY
THE
BETTER
ASSUME
THEM
AND
BESIDES
IT
IS
GREATNESS
IN
MAN
TO
BE
THE
CARE
OF
THE
HIGHER
POWERS
SO
CAESAR
SAID
TO
THE
PILOT
IN
THE
TEMPEST
CAESAREM

ET

EJUS
SO
SYLLA
CHOSE
THE
NAME
OF
FELIX
AND
NOT
OF

AND
IT
HATH
BEEN
NOTED
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ASCRIBE
OPENLY
TOO
MUCH
TO
THEIR
OWN
WISDOM
AND
POLICY
END
INFORTUNATE
IT
IS
WRITTEN
THAT
TIMOTHEUS
THE
ATHENIAN
AFTER
HE
HAD
IN
THE
ACCOUNT
HE
GAVE
TO
THE
STATE
OF
HIS
GOVERNMENT
OFTEN
INTERLACED
THIS
SPEECH
AND
IN
THIS
FORTUNE
HAD
NO
PART
NEVER
PROSPERED
IN
ANYTHING
HE
UNDERTOOK
AFTERWARDS
CERTAINLY
THERE
BE
WHOSE
FORTUNES
ARE
LIKE
HOMER
VERSES
THAT
HAVE
SLIDE
AND
EASINESS
MORE
THAN
THE
VERSES
OF
OTHER
POETS
AS
PLUTARCH
SAITH
OF
TIMOLEON
FORTUNE
IN
RESPECT
OF
THAT
OF
AGESILAUS
OR
EPAMINONDAS
AND
THAT
THIS
SHOULD
BE
NO
DOUBT
IT
IS
MUCH
IN
MAN
SELF
OF
USURY
MANY
HAVE
MADE
WITTY
INVECTIVES
AGAINST
USURY
THEY
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
PITY
THE
DEVIL
SHOULD
HAVE
GOD
PART
WHICH
IS
THE
TITHE
THAT
THE
USURER
IS
THE
GREATEST
SABBATH
BREAKER
BECAUSE
HIS
PLOUGH
GOETH
EVERY
SUNDAY
THAT
THE
USURER
IS
THE
DRONE
THAT
VIRGIL
SPEAKETH
OF
IGNAVUM
FUCOS
PECUS
PRAESEPIBUS
ARCENT
THAT
THE
USURER
BREAKETH
THE
FIRST
LAW
THAT
WAS
MADE
FOR
MANKIND
AFTER
THE
FALL
WHICH
WAS
IN
SUDORE
VULTUS
TUI
COMEDES
PANEM
TUUM
NOT
IN
SUDORE
VULTUS
ALIENI
THAT
USURERS
SHOULD
HAVE
ORANGE
TAWNY
BONNETS
BECAUSE
THEY
DO
JUDAIZE
THAT
IT
IS
AGAINST
NATURE
FOR
MONEY
TO
BEGET
MONEY
AND
THE
LIKE
SAY
THIS
ONLY
THAT
USURY
IS
CONCESSUM
PROPTER
DURITIEM
CORDIS
FOR
SINCE
THERE
MUST
BE
BORROWING
AND
LENDING
AND
MEN
ARE
SO
HARD
OF
HEART
AS
THEY
WILL
NOT
LEND
FREELY
USURY
MUST
BE
PERMITTED
SOME
OTHERS
HAVE
MADE
SUSPICIOUS
AND
CUNNING
PROPOSITIONS
OF
BANKS
DISCOVERY
OF
MEN
ESTATES
AND
OTHER
INVENTIONS
BUT
FEW
HAVE
SPOKEN
OF
USURY
USEFULLY
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
SET
BEFORE
US
THE
INCOMMODITIES
AND
COMMODITIES
OF
USURY
THAT
THE
GOOD
MAY
BE
EITHER
WEIGHED
OUT
OR
CULLED
OUT
AND
WARILY
TO
PROVIDE
THAT
WHILE
WE
MAKE
FORTH
TO
THAT
WHICH
IS
BETTER
WE
MEET
NOT
WITH
THAT
WHICH
IS
WORSE
THE
DISCOMMODITIES
OF
USURY
ARE
FIRST
THAT
IT
MAKES
FEWER
MERCHANTS
FOR
WERE
IT
NOT
FOR
THIS
LAZY
TRADE
OF
USURY
MONEY
WOULD
NOT
BE
STILL
BUT
WOULD
IN
GREAT
PART
BE
EMPLOYED
UPON
MERCHANDIZING
WHICH
IS
THE
VENA
PORTA
OF
WEALTH
IN
STATE
THE
SECOND
THAT
IT
MAKES
POOR
MERCHANTS
FOR
AS
FARMER
CANNOT
HUSBAND
HIS
GROUND
SO
WELL
IF
HE
SIT
AT
GREAT
RENT
SO
THE
MERCHANT
CANNOT
DRIVE
HIS
TRADE
SO
WELL
IF
HE
SIT
AT
GREAT
USURY
THE
THIRD
IS
INCIDENT
TO
THE
OTHER
TWO
AND
THAT
IS
THE
DECAY
OF
CUSTOMS
OF
KINGS
OR
STATES
WHICH
EBB
OR
FLOW
WITH
MERCHANDIZING
THE
FOURTH
THAT
IT
BRINGETH
THE
TREASURE
OF
REALM
OR
STATE
INTO
FEW
HANDS
FOR
THE
USURER
BEING
AT
CERTAINTIES
AND
OTHERS
AT
UNCERTAINTIES
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
GAME
MOST
OF
THE
MONEY
WILL
BE
IN
THE
BOX
AND
EVER
STATE
FLOURISHETH
WHEN
WEALTH
IS
MORE
EQUALLY
SPREAD
THE
FIFTH
THAT
IT
BEATS
DOWN
THE
PRICE
OF
LAND
FOR
THE
EMPLOYMENT
OF
MONEY
IS
CHIEFLY
EITHER
MERCHANDIZING
OR
PURCHASING
AND
USURY
WAYLAYS
BOTH
THE
SIXTH
THAT
IT
DOTH
DULL
AND
DAMP
ALL
INDUSTRIES
IMPROVEMENTS
AND
NEW
INVENTIONS
WHEREIN
MONEY
WOULD
BE
STIRRING
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
FOR
THIS
SLUG
THE
LAST
THAT
IT
IS
THE
CANKER
AND
RUIN
OF
MANY
MEN
ESTATES
WHICH
IN
PROCESS
OF
TIME
BREEDS
PUBLIC
POVERTY
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
THE
COMMODITIES
OF
USURY
ARE
FIRST
THAT
HOWSOEVER
USURY
IN
SOME
RESPECT
HINDERETH
MERCHANDIZING
YET
IN
SOME
OTHER
IT
ADVANCETH
IT
FOR
IT
IS
CERTAIN
THAT
THE
GREATEST
PART
OF
TRADE
IS
DRIVEN
BY
YOUNG
MERCHANTS
UPON
BORROWING
AT
INTEREST
SO
AS
IF
THE
USURER
EITHER
CALL
IN
OR
KEEP
BACK
HIS
MONEY
THERE
WILL
ENSUE
PRESENTLY
GREAT
STAND
OF
TRADE
THE
SECOND
IS
THAT
WERE
IT
NOT
FOR
THIS
EASY
BORROWING
UPON
INTEREST
MEN
NECESSITIES
WOULD
DRAW
UPON
THEM
MOST
SUDDEN
UNDOING
IN
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BE
FORCED
TO
SELL
THEIR
MEANS
BE
IT
LANDS
OR
GOODS
FAR
UNDER
FOOT
AND
SO
WHEREAS
USURY
DOTH
BUT
GNAW
UPON
THEM
BAD
MARKETS
WOULD
SWALLOW
THEM
QUITE
UP
AS
FOR
MORTGAGING
OR
PAWNING
IT
WILL
LITTLE
MEND
THE
MATTER
FOR
EITHER
MEN
WILL
NOT
TAKE
PAWNS
WITHOUT
USE
OR
IF
THEY
DO
THEY
WILL
LOOK
PRECISELY
FOR
THE
FORFEITURE
REMEMBER
CRUEL
MONEYED
MAN
IN
THE
COUNTRY
THAT
WOULD
SAY
THE
DEVIL
TAKE
THIS
USURY
IT
KEEPS
US
FROM
FORFEITURES
OF
MORTGAGES
AND
BONDS
THE
THIRD
AND
LAST
IS
THAT
IT
IS
VANITY
TO
CONCEIVE
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
ORDINARY
BORROWING
WITHOUT
PROFIT
AND
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
CONCEIVE
THE
NUMBER
OF
INCONVENIENCES
THAT
WILL
ENSUE
IF
BORROWING
BE
CRAMPED
THEREFORE
TO
SPEAK
OF
THE
ABOLISHING
OF
USURY
IS
IDLE
ALL
STATES
HAVE
EVER
HAD
IT
IN
ONE
KIND
OR
RATE
OR
OTHER
SO
AS
THAT
OPINION
MUST
BE
SENT
TO
UTOPIA
TO
SPEAK
NOW
OF
THE
REFORMATION
AND
REIGLEMENT
OF
USURY
HOW
THE
DISCOMMODITIES
OF
IT
MAY
BE
BEST
AVOIDED
AND
THE
COMMODITIES
RETAINED
IT
APPEARS
BY
THE
BALANCE
OF
COMMODITIES
AND
DISCOMMODITIES
OF
USURY
TWO
THINGS
ARE
TO
BE
RECONCILED
THE
ONE
THAT
THE
TOOTH
OF
USURY
BE
GRINDED
THAT
IT
BITE
NOT
TOO
MUCH
THE
OTHER
THAT
THERE
BE
LEFT
OPEN
MEANS
TO
INVITE
MONEYED
MEN
TO
LEND
TO
THE
MERCHANTS
FOR
THE
CONTINUING
AND
QUICKENING
OF
TRADE
THIS
CANNOT
BE
DONE
EXCEPT
YOU
INTRODUCE
TWO
SEVERAL
SORTS
OF
USURY
LESS
AND
GREATER
FOR
IF
YOU
REDUCE
USURY
TO
ONE
LOW
RATE
IT
WILL
EASE
THE
COMMON
BORROWER
BUT
THE
MERCHANT
WILL
BE
TO
SEEK
FOR
MONEY
AND
IT
IS
TO
BE
NOTED
THAT
THE
TRADE
OF
MERCHANDIZE
BEING
THE
MOST
LUCRATIVE
MAY
BEAR
USURY
AT
GOOD
RATE
OTHER
CONTRACTS
NOT
SO
TO
SERVE
BOTH
INTENTIONS
THE
WAY
WOULD
BE
BRIEFLY
THUS
THAT
THERE
BE
TWO
RATES
OF
USURY
THE
ONE
FREE
AND
GENERAL
FOR
ALL
THE
OTHER
UNDER
LICENSE
ONLY
TO
CERTAIN
PERSONS
AND
IN
CERTAIN
PLACES
OF
MERCHANDIZING
FIRST
THEREFORE
LET
USURY
IN
GENERAL
BE
REDUCED
TO
FIVE
IN
THE
HUNDRED
AND
LET
THAT
RATE
BE
PROCLAIMED
TO
BE
FREE
AND
CURRENT
AND
LET
THE
STATE
SHUT
ITSELF
OUT
TO
TAKE
ANY
PENALTY
FOR
THE
SAME
THIS
WILL
PRESERVE
BORROWING
FROM
ANY
GENERAL
STOP
OR
DRYNESS
THIS
WILL
EASE
INFINITE
BORROWERS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
THIS
WILL
IN
GOOD
PART
RAISE
THE
PRICE
OF
LAND
BECAUSE
LAND
PURCHASED
AT
SIXTEEN
YEARS
PURCHASE
WILL
YIELD
SIX
IN
THE
HUNDRED
AND
SOMEWHAT
MORE
WHEREAS
THIS
RATE
OF
INTEREST
YIELDS
BUT
FIVE
THIS
BY
LIKE
REASON
WILL
ENCOURAGE
AND
EDGE
INDUSTRIOUS
AND
PROFITABLE
IMPROVEMENTS
BECAUSE
MANY
WILL
RATHER
VENTURE
IN
THAT
KIND
THAN
TAKE
FIVE
IN
THE
HUNDRED
ESPECIALLY
HAVING
BEEN
USED
TO
GREATER
PROFIT
SECONDLY
LET
THERE
BE
CERTAIN
PERSONS
LICENSED
TO
LEND
TO
KNOWN
MERCHANTS
UPON
USURY
AT
HIGHER
RATE
AND
LET
IT
BE
WITH
THE
CAUTIONS
FOLLOWING
LET
THE
RATE
BE
EVEN
WITH
THE
MERCHANT
HIMSELF
SOMEWHAT
MORE
EASY
THAN
THAT
HE
USED
FORMERLY
TO
PAY
FOR
BY
THAT
MEANS
ALL
BORROWERS
SHALL
HAVE
SOME
EASE
BY
THIS
REFORMATION
BE
HE
MERCHANT
OR
WHOSOEVER
LET
IT
BE
NO
BANK
OR
COMMON
STOCK
BUT
EVERY
MAN
BE
MASTER
OF
HIS
OWN
MONEY
NOT
THAT
ALTOGETHER
MISLIKE
BANKS
BUT
THEY
WILL
HARDLY
BE
BROOKED
IN
REGARD
OF
CERTAIN
SUSPICIONS
LET
THE
STATE
BE
ANSWERED
SOME
SMALL
MATTER
FOR
THE
LICENSE
AND
THE
REST
LEFT
TO
THE
LENDER
FOR
IF
THE
ABATEMENT
BE
BUT
SMALL
IT
WILL
NO
WHIT
DISCOURAGE
THE
LENDER
FOR
HE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
TOOK
BEFORE
TEN
OR
NINE
IN
THE
HUNDRED
WILL
SOONER
DESCEND
TO
EIGHT
IN
THE
HUNDRED
THAN
GIVE
OVER
HIS
TRADE
OF
USURY
AND
GO
FROM
CERTAIN
GAINS
TO
GAINS
OF
HAZARD
LET
THESE
LICENSED
LENDERS
BE
IN
NUMBER
INDEFINITE
BUT
RESTRAINED
TO
CERTAIN
PRINCIPAL
CITIES
AND
TOWNS
OF
MERCHANDIZING
FOR
THEN
THEY
WILL
BE
HARDLY
ABLE
TO
COLOR
OTHER
MEN
MONEYS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
SO
AS
THE
LICENSE
OF
NINE
WILL
NOT
SUCK
AWAY
THE
CURRENT
RATE
OF
FIVE
FOR
NO
MAN
WILL
SEND
HIS
MONEYS
FAR
OFF
NOR
PUT
THEM
INTO
UNKNOWN
HANDS
IF
IT
BE
OBJECTED
THAT
THIS
DOTH
IN
SORT
AUTHORIZE
USURY
WHICH
BEFORE
WAS
IN
SOME
PLACES
BUT
PERMISSIVE
THE
ANSWER
IS
THAT
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
MITIGATE
USURY
BY
DECLARATION
THAN
TO
SUFFER
IT
TO
RAGE
BY
CONNIVANCE
OF
YOUTH
AND
AGE
MAN
THAT
IS
YOUNG
IN
YEARS
MAY
BE
OLD
IN

IF
HE
HAVE
LOST
NO
TIME
BUT
THAT
HAPPENETH
RARELY
GENERALLY
YOUTH
IS
LIKE
THE
FIRST
COGITATIONS
NOT
SO
WISE
AS
THE
SECOND
FOR
THERE
IS
YOUTH
IN
THOUGHTS
AS
WELL
AS
IN
AGES
AND
YET
THE
INVENTION
OF
YOUNG
MEN
IS
MORE
LIVELY
THAN
THAT
OF
OLD
AND
IMAGINATIONS
STREAM
INTO
THEIR
MINDS
BETTER
AND
AS
IT
WERE
MORE
DIVINELY
NATURES
THAT
HAVE
MUCH
HEAT
AND
GREAT
AND
VIOLENT
DESIRES
AND
PERTURBATIONS
ARE
NOT
RIPE
FOR
ACTION
TILL
THEY
HAVE
PASSED
THE
MERIDIAN
OF
THEIR
YEARS
AS
IT
WAS
WITH
JULIUS
CAESAR
AND
SEPTIMIUS
SEVERUS
OF
THE

OF
WHOM
IT
IS

EGIT

PLENAM
AND
YET
HE
WAS
THE

EMPEROR
ALMOST
OF

IN

AS
IT
IS

IN

COSMUS
DUKE
OF

GASTON
DE
FOIX
AND
OTHERS
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
HEAT
AND
VIVACITY
IN

IS
AN
EXCELLENT
COMPOSITION
FOR
BUSINESS
YOUNG
MEN
ARE
FITTER
TO
INVENT
THAN
TO
JUDGE
FITTER
FOR
EXECUTION
THAN
FOR
COUNSEL
AND
FITTER
FOR
NEW

THAN
FOR
SETTLED

FOR
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF

IN

THAT
FALL
WITHIN
THE
COMPASS
OF
IT
DIRECTETH
THEM
BUT
IN
NEW
THINGS
ABUSETH
THEM
THE
ERRORS
OF
YOUNG
MEN
ARE
THE
RUIN
OF

BUT
THE
ERRORS
OF
AGED

AMOUNT
BUT
TO
THIS
THAT
MORE
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
OR
SOONER
YOUNG
MEN
IN
THE
CONDUCT
AND
MANAGE
OF

EMBRACE
MORE
THAN
THEY
CAN
HOLD
STIR
MORE
THAN
THEY
CAN
QUIET
FLY
TO
THE
END
WITHOUT
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
MEANS
AND
DEGREES
PURSUE
SOME

WHICH
THEY
HAVE
CHANCED
UPON
ABSURDLY
CARE
NOT

WHICH
DRAWS

INCONVENIENCES
USE
EXTREME
REMEDIES
AT

AND
THAT
WHICH
DOUBLETH
ALL
ERRORS
WILL
NOT
ACKNOWLEDGE
OR
RETRACT
THEM
LIKE
AN

THAT
WILL
NEITHER

OBJECT
TOO
MUCH

TOO

TOO
SOON
AND
SELDOM
DRIVE

BUT
CONTENT

WITH

OF

CERTAINLY
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
COMPOUND
EMPLOYMENTS
OF

FOR
THAT
WILL
BE
GOOD
FOR
THE
PRESENT
BECAUSE
THE
VIRTUES
OF
EITHER
AGE
MAY
CORRECT
THE
DEFECTS
OF
BOTH
AND
GOOD
FOR
SUCCESSION
THAT
YOUNG
MEN
MAY
BE
LEARNERS
WHILE
MEN
IN

ARE
ACTORS
AND
LASTLY
GOOD
FOR
EXTERN
ACCIDENTS
BECAUSE
AUTHORITY
FOLLOWETH

BUT
FOR

PERHAPS

INFERRETH
THAT

ARE

IS
IT

OF

AS
IF

WERE

NOT

AND
THEREFORE
THEY
PROVE

BUT
NOT

RATHER

BUT
THIS
HOLDS

PHILIP

EDWARD
THE

OF

ALCIBIADES
OF

WERE

HIGH

GREAT
SPIRITS
AND

THE
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
MEN
OF
THEIR

IN
BEAUTY
THAT
OF
FAVOR
IS
MORE
THAN
THAT
OF
COLOR
AND
THAT
OF
DECENT
AND
GRACIOUS
MOTION
MORE
THAN
THAT
OF

THAT
IS
THE
BEST
PART
OF
BEAUTY
WHICH
PICTURE
CANNOT
EXPRESS
NO
NOR
THE
FIRST
SIGHT
OF
THE
LIFE
THERE
IS
NO
EXCELLENT
BEAUTY
THAT
HATH
NOT
SOME
STRANGENESS
IN
THE
PROPORTION
MAN
CANNOT
TELL
WHETHER
APELLES
OR
ALBERT
DURER
WERE
THE

TRIFLER
WHEREOF
THE

WOULD

BY

THE

BY

NOBODY
BUT
THE

THAT

NOT

THINK

MAY
MAKE
BETTER

THAN

WAS
BUT
HE
MUST
DO
IT
BY
KIND
OF
FELICITY
AS
MUSICIAN
THAT
MAKETH
AN
EXCELLENT
AIR
IN

AND
NOT
BY

MAN
SHALL
SEE
FACES
THAT
IF
YOU
EXAMINE
THEM
PART
BY
PART
YOU
SHALL
FIND
NEVER
GOOD
AND
YET
ALTOGETHER
DO
WELL
IF
IT
BE
TRUE
THAT
THE
PRINCIPAL
PART
OF
BEAUTY
IS
IN
DECENT
MOTION
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
NO
MARVEL
THOUGH
PERSONS
IN
YEARS
SEEM
MANY
TIMES
MORE
AMIABLE
PULCHRORUM
AUTUMNUS
PULCHER
FOR
NO
YOUTH
CAN
BE
COMELY
BUT
BY
PARDON
AND
CONSIDERING
THE
YOUTH
AS
TO
MAKE
UP
THE
COMELINESS
BEAUTY
IS
AS
SUMMER
FRUITS
WHICH
ARE
EASY
TO
CORRUPT
AND
CANNOT
LAST
AND
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
IT
MAKES
DISSOLUTE
YOUTH
AND
AN
AGE
LITTLE
OUT
OF
COUNTENANCE
BUT
YET
CERTAINLY
AGAIN
IF
IT
LIGHT
WELL
IT
MAKETH
VIRTUE
SHINE
AND
VICES
BLUSH
OF
DEFORMITY
DEFORMED
PERSONS
ARE
COMMONLY
EVEN
WITH
NATURE
FOR
AS
NATURE
HATH
DONE
ILL
BY
THEM
SO
DO
THEY
BY
NATURE
BEING
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
AS
THE
SCRIPTURE
SAITH
VOID
OF
NATURAL
AFFECTION
AND
SO
THEY
HAVE
THEIR
REVENGE
OF
NATURE
CERTAINLY
THERE
IS
CONSENT
BETWEEN
THE
BODY
AND
THE
MIND
AND
WHERE
NATURE
ERRETH
IN
THE
ONE
SHE
VENTURETH
IN
THE
OTHER
UBI
PECCAT
IN
UNO
PERICLITATUR
IN
ALTERO
BUT
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
IN
MAN
AN
ELECTION
TOUCHING
THE
FRAME
OF
HIS
MIND
AND
NECESSITY
IN
THE
FRAME
OF
HIS
BODY
THE
STARS
OF
NATURAL
INCLINATION
ARE
SOMETIMES
OBSCURED
BY
THE
SUN
OF
DISCIPLINE
AND
VIRTUE
THEREFORE
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
CONSIDER
OF
DEFORMITY
NOT
AS
SIGN
WHICH
IS
MORE
DECEIVABLE
BUT
AS
CAUSE
WHICH
SELDOM
FAILETH
OF
THE
EFFECT
WHOSOEVER
HATH
ANYTHING
FIXED
IN
HIS
PERSON
THAT
DOTH
INDUCE
CONTEMPT
HATH
ALSO
PERPETUAL
SPUR
IN
HIMSELF
TO
RESCUE
AND
DELIVER
HIMSELF
FROM
SCORN
THEREFORE
ALL
DEFORMED
PERSONS
ARE
EXTREME
BOLD
FIRST
AS
IN
THEIR
OWN
DEFENCE
AS
BEING
EXPOSED
TO
SCORN
BUT
IN
PROCESS
OF
TIME
BY
GENERAL
HABIT
ALSO
IT
STIRRETH
IN
THEM
INDUSTRY
AND
ESPECIALLY
OF
THIS
KIND
TO
WATCH
AND
OBSERVE
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
OTHERS
THAT
THEY
MAY
HAVE
SOMEWHAT
TO
REPAY
AGAIN
IN
THEIR
SUPERIORS
IT
QUENCHETH
JEALOUSY
TOWARDS
THEM
AS
PERSONS
THAT
THEY
THINK
THEY
MAY
AT
PLEASURE
DESPISE
AND
IT
LAYETH
THEIR
COMPETITORS
AND
EMULATORS
ASLEEP
AS
NEVER
BELIEVING
THEY
SHOULD
BE
IN
POSSIBILITY
OF
ADVANCEMENT
TILL
THEY
SEE
THEM
IN
POSSESSION
SO
THAT
UPON
THE
MATTER
IN
GREAT
WIT
DEFORMITY
IS
AN
ADVANTAGE
TO
RISING
KINGS
IN
ANCIENT
TIMES
AND
AT
THIS
PRESENT
IN
SOME
COUNTRIES
WERE
WONT
TO
PUT
GREAT
TRUST
IN
EUNUCHS
BECAUSE
THEY
THAT
ARE
ENVIOUS
TOWARDS
ALL
ARE
MORE
OBNOXIOUS
AND
OFFICIOUS
TOWARDS
ONE
BUT
YET
THEIR
TRUST
TOWARDS
THEM
HATH
RATHER
BEEN
AS
TO
GOOD
SPIALS
AND
GOOD
WHISPERERS
THAN
GOOD
MAGISTRATES
AND
OFFICERS
AND
MUCH
LIKE
IS
THE
REASON
OF
DEFORMED
PERSONS
STILL
THE
GROUND
IS
THEY
WILL
IF
THEY
BE
OF
SPIRIT
SEEK
TO
FREE
THEMSELVES
FROM
SCORN
WHICH
MUST
BE
EITHER
BY
VIRTUE
OR
MALICE
AND
THEREFORE
LET
IT
NOT
BE
MARVELLED
IF
SOMETIMES
THEY
PROVE
EXCELLENT
PERSONS
AS
WAS
AGESILAUS
ZANGER
THE
SON
OF
SOLYMAN
AESOP
GASCA
PRESIDENT
OF

AND
SOCRATES
MAY
GO
LIKEWISE
AMONGST
THEM
WITH
OTHERS
OF
BUILDING
HOUSES
ARE
BUILT
TO
LIVE
IN
AND
NOT
TO
LOOK
ON
THEREFORE
LET
USE
BE
PREFERRED
BEFORE
UNIFORMITY
EXCEPT
WHERE
BOTH
MAY
BE
HAD
LEAVE
THE
GOODLY
FABRICS
OF
HOUSES
FOR

ONLY
TO
THE

OF

WITH

COMMITTETH
HIMSELF
TO

NEITHER
DO
RECKON
IT
AN
ILL

ONLY
WHERE
THE
AIR
IS
UNWHOLESOME
BUT
LIKEWISE
WHERE
THE

AS
YOU
SHALL
SEE
MANY
FINE

SET
UPON

OF

ENVIRONED
WITH

ROUND
ABOUT

WHEREBY
THE

OF

GATHERETH

SO
AS
YOU
SHALL
HAVE
AND
THAT
SUDDENLY
AS
GREAT
DIVERSITY
OF
HEAT
AND
COLD
AS
IF
YOU
DWELT
IN
SEVERAL

NEITHER
IS
IT
ILL

ONLY
THAT
MAKETH
AN
ILL

BUT
ILL

ILL

AND
IF

WITH

SPEAK
NOT

OF

OF

OF

WANT
OF

AT
SOME
NEAR

FOR

OF

HAWKING
AND

TOO
NEAR
THE

TOO
REMOTE
HAVING
THE
COMMODITY
OF

RIVERS
OR
THE
DISCOMMODITY
OF
THEIR
OVERFLOWING
TOO
FAR
OFF
FROM
GREAT

WHICH
MAY
HINDER

WHICH
LURCHETH
ALL

TOGETHER
AND
WHERE
HE
IS

ALL
WHICH
AS
IT
IS

PERHAPS

SO
IT
IS
GOOD
TO

AND
THINK
OF
THEM
THAT
MAN
MAY
TAKE
AS
MANY
AS
HE
CAN
AND
IF

HAVE
SEVERAL

WHO
WHEN

HIS

SO

SAID
SURELY
AN

FOR

HOW
DO
YOU
IN

LUCULLUS
ANSWERED
WHY
DO
YOU
NOT
THINK

AS

ARE
THAT

TO

FROM

WHEREOF
THE

DELIVERS
THE
PRECEPTS
OF
THE
ART
AND
THE
LATTER
THE
PERFECTION
WE
WILL
THEREFORE
DESCRIBE
PRINCELY
PALACE
MAKING
BRIEF
MODEL
THEREOF
FOR
IT
IS
STRANGE
TO
SEE
NOW
IN
EUROPE
SUCH
HUGE
BUILDINGS
AS
THE
VATICAN
AND
ESCURIAL
AND
SOME
OTHERS
BE
AND
YET
SCARCE
VERY
FAIR
ROOM
IN
THEM
FIRST
THEREFORE
SAY
YOU
CANNOT
HAVE
PERFECT
PALACE
EXCEPT
YOU
HAVE
TWO
SEVERAL
SIDES
SIDE
FOR
THE
BANQUET
AS
IT
IS
SPOKEN
OF
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
HESTER
AND
SIDE
FOR
THE
HOUSEHOLD
THE
ONE
FOR
FEASTS
AND
TRIUMPHS
AND
THE
OTHER
FOR
DWELLING
UNDERSTAND
BOTH
THESE
SIDES
TO
BE
NOT
ONLY
RETURNS
BUT
PARTS
OF
THE
FRONT
AND
TO
BE
UNIFORM
WITHOUT
THOUGH
SEVERALLY
PARTITIONED
WITHIN
AND
TO
BE
ON
BOTH
SIDES
OF
GREAT
AND
STATELY
TOWER
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
FRONT
THAT
AS
IT
WERE
JOINETH
THEM
TOGETHER
ON
EITHER
HAND
WOULD
HAVE
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BANQUET
IN
FRONT
ONE
ONLY
GOODLY
ROOM
ABOVE
STAIRS
OF
SOME
FORTY
FOOT
HIGH
AND
UNDER
IT
ROOM
FOR
DRESSING
OR
PREPARING
PLACE
AT
TIMES
OF
TRIUMPHS
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
WHICH
IS
THE
HOUSEHOLD
SIDE
WISH
IT
DIVIDED
AT
THE
FIRST
INTO
HALL
AND
CHAPEL
WITH
PARTITION
BETWEEN
BOTH
OF
GOOD
STATE
AND
BIGNESS
AND
THOSE
NOT
TO
GO
ALL
THE
LENGTH
BUT
TO
HAVE
AT
THE
FURTHER
END
WINTER
AND
SUMMER
PARLOR
BOTH
FAIR
AND
UNDER
THESE
ROOMS
FAIR
AND
LARGE
CELLAR
SUNK
UNDER

AND
LIKEWISE
SOME

WITH

AND
SUCH
LIKE
THESE
PARTICULARS
ARE
FOR
THE
CLIMATE
OF
LONDON
BUT
MY
MEANING
IS
PERCEIVED
THAT
YOU
MAY
HAVE
VER
PERPETUUM
AS
THE
PLACE
AFFORDS
AND
BECAUSE
THE
BREATH
OF
FLOWERS
IS
FAR
SWEETER
IN
THE
AIR
WHERE
IT
COMES
AND
GOES
LIKE
THE
WARBLING
OF
MUSIC
THAN
IN
THE
HAND
THEREFORE
NOTHING
IS
MORE
FIT
FOR
THAT
DELIGHT
THAN
TO
KNOW
WHAT
BE
THE
FLOWERS
AND
PLANTS
THAT
DO
BEST
PERFUME
THE
AIR
ROSES
DAMASK
AND
RED
ARE
FAST
FLOWERS
OF
THEIR
SMELLS
SO
THAT
YOU
MAY
WALK
BY
WHOLE
ROW
OF
THEM
AND
FIND
NOTHING
OF
THEIR
SWEETNESS
YEA
THOUGH
IT
BE
IN
MORNING
DEW
BAYS
LIKEWISE
YIELD
NO
SMELL
AS
THEY
GROW
ROSEMARY
LITTLE
NOR
SWEET
MARJORAM
THAT
WHICH
ABOVE
ALL
OTHERS
YIELDS
THE
SWEETEST
SMELL
IN
THE
AIR
IS
THE
VIOLET
SPECIALLY
THE
WHITE
DOUBLE
VIOLET
WHICH
COMES
TWICE
YEAR
ABOUT
THE
MIDDLE
OF
APRIL
AND
ABOUT
BARTHOLOMEW
TIDE
NEXT
TO
THAT
IS
THE
MUSK
ROSE
THEN
THE
STRAWBERRY
LEAVES
DYING
WHICH
YIELD
MOST
EXCELLENT
CORDIAL
SMELL
THEN
THE
FLOWER
OF
VINES
IT
IS
LITTLE
DUST
LIKE
THE
DUST
OF
BENT
WHICH
GROWS
UPON
THE
CLUSTER
IN
THE
FIRST
COMING
FORTH
THEN
SWEET
BRIAR
THEN
WALL
FLOWERS
WHICH
ARE
VERY
DELIGHTFUL
TO
BE
SET
UNDER
PARLOR
OR
LOWER
CHAMBER
WINDOW
THEN
PINKS
AND
GILLIFLOWERS
ESPECIALLY
THE
MATTED
PINK
AND
CLOVE
GILLIFLOWER
THEN
THE
FLOWERS
OF
THE
LIME
TREE
THEN
THE
HONEYSUCKLES
SO
THEY
BE
SOMEWHAT
AFAR
OFF
OF
BEANFLOWERS
SPEAK
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
FIELD
FLOWERS
BUT
THOSE
WHICH
PERFUME
THE
AIR
MOST
DELIGHTFULLY
NOT
PASSED
BY
AS
THE
REST
BUT
BEING
TRODDEN
UPON
AND
CRUSHED
ARE
THREE
THAT
IS
BURNET
WILDTHYME
AND
WATERMINTS
THEREFORE
YOU
ARE
TO
SET
WHOLE
ALLEYS
OF
THEM
TO
HAVE
THE
PLEASURE
WHEN
YOU
WALK
OR
TREAD
FOR
GARDENS
SPEAKING
OF
THOSE
WHICH
ARE
INDEED
PRINCELIKE
AS
WE
HAVE
DONE
OF
BUILDINGS
THE
CONTENTS
OUGHT
NOT
WELL
TO
BE
UNDER
THIRTY
ACRES
OF
GROUND
AND
TO
BE
DIVIDED
INTO
THREE
PARTS
GREEN
IN
THE
ENTRANCE
HEATH
OR
DESERT
IN
THE
GOING
FORTH
AND
THE
MAIN
GARDEN
IN
THE
MIDST
BESIDES
ALLEYS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
AND
LIKE
WELL
THAT
FOUR
ACRES
OF
GROUND
BE
ASSIGNED
TO
THE
GREEN
SIX
TO
THE
HEATH
FOUR
AND
FOUR
TO
EITHER
SIDE
AND
TWELVE
TO
THE
MAIN
GARDEN
THE
GREEN
HATH
TWO
PLEASURES
THE
ONE
BECAUSE
NOTHING
IS
MORE
PLEASANT
TO
THE
EYE
THAN
GREEN
GRASS
KEPT
FINELY
SHORN
THE
OTHER
BECAUSE
IT
WILL
GIVE
YOU
FAIR
ALLEY
IN
THE
MIDST
BY
WHICH
YOU
MAY
GO
IN
FRONT
UPON
STATELY
HEDGE
WHICH
IS
TO
ENCLOSE
THE
GARDEN
BUT
BECAUSE
THE
ALLEY
WILL
BE
LONG
AND
IN
GREAT
HEAT
OF
THE
YEAR
OR
DAY
YOU
OUGHT
NOT
TO
BUY
THE
SHADE
IN
THE
GARDEN
BY
GOING
IN
THE
SUN
THROUGH
THE
GREEN
THEREFORE
YOU
ARE
OF
EITHER
SIDE
THE
GREEN
TO
PLANT
COVERT
ALLEY
UPON
CARPENTER
WORK
ABOUT
TWELVE
FOOT
IN
HEIGHT
BY
WHICH
YOU
MAY
GO
IN
SHADE
INTO
THE
GARDEN
AS
FOR
THE
MAKING
OF
KNOTS
OR
FIGURES
WITH
DIVERS
COLORED
EARTHS
THAT
THEY
MAY
LIE
UNDER
THE
WINDOWS
OF
THE
HOUSE
ON
THAT
SIDE
WHICH
THE
GARDEN
STANDS
THEY
BE
BUT
TOYS
YOU
MAY
SEE
AS
GOOD
SIGHTS
MANY
TIMES
IN
TARTS
THE
GARDEN
IS
BEST
TO
BE
SQUARE
ENCOMPASSED
ON
ALL
THE
FOUR
SIDES
WITH
STATELY
ARCHED
HEDGE
THE
ARCHES
TO
BE
UPON
PILLARS
OF
CARPENTER
WORK
OF
SOME
TEN
FOOT
HIGH
AND
SIX
FOOT
BROAD
AND
THE
SPACES
BETWEEN
OF
THE
SAME
DIMENSION
WITH
THE
BREADTH
OF
THE
ARCH
OVER
THE
ARCHES
LET
THERE
BE
AN
ENTIRE
HEDGE
OF
SOME
FOUR
FOOT
HIGH
FRAMED
ALSO
UPON
CARPENTER
WORK
AND
UPON
THE
UPPER
HEDGE
OVER
EVERY
ARCH
LITTLE
TURRET
WITH
BELLY
ENOUGH
TO
RECEIVE
CAGE
OF
BIRDS
AND
OVER
EVERY
SPACE
BETWEEN
THE
ARCHES
SOME
OTHER
LITTLE
FIGURE
WITH
BROAD
PLATES
OF
ROUND
COLORED
GLASS
GILT
FOR
THE
SUN
TO
PLAY
UPON
BUT
THIS
HEDGE
INTEND
TO
BE
RAISED
UPON
BANK
NOT
STEEP
BUT
GENTLY
SLOPE
OF
SOME
SIX
FOOT
SET
ALL
WITH
FLOWERS
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THIS
SQUARE
OF
THE
GARDEN
SHOULD
NOT
BE
THE
WHOLE
BREADTH
OF
THE
GROUND
BUT
TO
LEAVE
ON
EITHER
SIDE
GROUND
ENOUGH
FOR
DIVERSITY
OF
SIDE
ALLEYS
UNTO
WHICH
THE
TWO
COVERT
ALLEYS
OF
THE
GREEN
MAY
DELIVER
YOU
BUT
THERE
MUST
BE
NO
ALLEYS
WITH
HEDGES
AT
EITHER
END
OF
THIS
GREAT
ENCLOSURE
NOT
AT
THE
HITHER
END
FOR
LETTING
YOUR
PROSPECT
UPON
THIS
FAIR
HEDGE
FROM
THE
GREEN
NOR
AT
THE
FURTHER
END
FOR
LETTING
YOUR
PROSPECT
FROM
THE
HEDGE
THROUGH
THE
ARCHES
UPON
THE
HEATH
FOR
THE
ORDERING
OF
THE
GROUND
WITHIN
THE
GREAT
HEDGE
LEAVE
IT
TO
VARIETY
OF
DEVICE
ADVISING
NEVERTHELESS
THAT
WHATSOEVER
FORM
YOU
CAST
IT
INTO
FIRST
IT
BE
NOT
TOO
BUSY
OR
FULL
OF
WORK
WHEREIN
FOR
MY
PART
DO
NOT
LIKE
IMAGES
CUT
OUT
IN
JUNIPER
OR
OTHER
GARDEN
STUFF
THEY
BE
FOR
CHILDREN
LITTLE
LOW
HEDGES
ROUND
LIKE
WELTS
WITH
SOME
PRETTY
PYRAMIDS
LIKE
WELL
AND
IN
SOME
PLACES
FAIR
COLUMNS
UPON
FRAMES
OF
CARPENTER
WORK
WOULD
ALSO
HAVE
THE
ALLEYS
SPACIOUS
AND
FAIR
YOU
MAY
HAVE
CLOSER
ALLEYS
UPON
THE
SIDE
GROUNDS
BUT
NONE
IN
THE
MAIN
GARDEN
WISH
ALSO
IN
THE
VERY
MIDDLE
FAIR
MOUNT
WITH
THREE
ASCENTS
AND
ALLEYS
ENOUGH
FOR
FOUR
TO
WALK
ABREAST
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
PERFECT
CIRCLES
WITHOUT
ANY
BULWARKS
OR
EMBOSSMENTS
AND
THE
WHOLE
MOUNT
TO
BE
THIRTY
FOOT
HIGH
AND
SOME
FINE
BANQUETING
HOUSE
WITH
SOME
CHIMNEYS
NEATLY
CAST
AND
WITHOUT
TOO
MUCH
GLASS
FOR
FOUNTAINS
THEY
ARE
GREAT
BEAUTY
AND
REFRESHMENT
BUT
POOLS
MAR
ALL
AND
MAKE
THE
GARDEN
UNWHOLESOME
AND
FULL
OF
FLIES
AND
FROGS
FOUNTAINS
INTEND
TO
BE
OF
TWO
NATURES
THE
ONE
THAT
SPRINKLETH
OR
SPOUTETH
WATER
THE
OTHER
FAIR
RECEIPT
OF
WATER
OF
SOME
THIRTY
OR
FORTY
FOOT
SQUARE
BUT
WITHOUT
FISH
OR
SLIME
OR
MUD
FOR
THE
FIRST
THE
ORNAMENTS
OF
IMAGES
GILT
OR
OF
MARBLE
WHICH
ARE
IN
USE
DO
WELL
BUT
THE
MAIN
MATTER
IS
SO
TO
CONVEY
THE
WATER
AS
IT
NEVER
STAY
EITHER
IN
THE
BOWLS
OR
IN
THE
CISTERN
THAT
THE
WATER
BE
NEVER
BY
REST
DISCOLORED
GREEN
OR
RED
OR
THE
LIKE
OR
GATHER
ANY
MOSSINESS
OR
PUTREFACTION
BESIDES
THAT
IT
IS
TO
BE
CLEANSED
EVERY
DAY
BY
THE
HAND
ALSO
SOME
STEPS
UP
TO
IT
AND
SOME
FINE
PAVEMENT
ABOUT
IT
DOTH
WELL
AS
FOR
THE
OTHER
KIND
OF
FOUNTAIN
WHICH
WE
MAY
CALL
BATHING
POOL
IT
MAY
ADMIT
MUCH
CURIOSITY
AND
BEAUTY
WHEREWITH
WE
WILL
NOT
TROUBLE
OURSELVES
AS
THAT
THE
BOTTOM
BE
FINELY
PAVED
AND
WITH
IMAGES
THE
SIDES
LIKEWISE
AND
WITHAL
EMBELLISHED
WITH
COLORED
GLASS
AND
SUCH
THINGS
OF
LUSTRE
ENCOMPASSED
ALSO
WITH
FINE
RAILS
OF
LOW
STATUAS
BUT
THE
MAIN
POINT
IS
THE
SAME
WHICH
WE
MENTIONED
IN
THE
FORMER
KIND
OF
FOUNTAIN
WHICH
IS
THAT
THE
WATER
BE
IN
PERPETUAL
MOTION
FED
BY
WATER
HIGHER
THAN
THE
POOL
AND
DELIVERED
INTO
IT
BY
FAIR
SPOUTS
AND
THEN
DISCHARGED
AWAY
UNDER
GROUND
BY
SOME
EQUALITY
OF
BORES
THAT
IT
STAY
LITTLE
AND
FOR
FINE
DEVICES
OF
ARCHING
WATER
WITHOUT
SPILLING
AND
MAKING
IT
RISE
IN
SEVERAL
FORMS
OF
FEATHERS
DRINKING
GLASSES
CANOPIES
AND
THE
LIKE
THEY
BE
PRETTY
THINGS
TO
LOOK
ON
BUT
NOTHING
TO
HEALTH
AND
SWEETNESS
FOR
THE
HEATH
WHICH
WAS
THE
THIRD
PART
OF
OUR
PLOT
WISH
IT
TO
BE
FRAMED
AS
MUCH
AS
MAY
BE
TO
NATURAL
WILDNESS
TREES
WOULD
HAVE

PRICKED
UPON

AND
PART
WITHOUT
THE

TO
BE
ROSES
JUNIPER
HOLLY

HERE

BECAUSE
OF
THE

OF
THEIR

RED
CURRANTS
GOOSEBERRIES
ROSEMARY
BAYS
SWEETBRIAR
AND
SUCH
LIKE
BUT
THESE
STANDARDS
TO
BE
KEPT
WITH
CUTTING
THAT
THEY
GROW
NOT
OUT
OF

FOR
THE
SIDE
GROUNDS
YOU
ARE
TO
FILL
THEM
WITH
VARIETY
OF
ALLEYS
PRIVATE
TO
GIVE
FULL
SHADE
SOME
OF
THEM
WHERESOEVER
THE
SUN
BE
YOU
ARE
TO
FRAME
SOME
OF
THEM
LIKEWISE
FOR
SHELTER
THAT
WHEN
THE
WIND
BLOWS
SHARP
YOU
MAY
WALK
AS
IN
GALLERY
AND
THOSE
ALLEYS
MUST
BE
LIKEWISE
HEDGED
AT
BOTH
ENDS
TO
KEEP
OUT
THE
WIND
AND
THESE
CLOSER
ALLEYS
MUST
BE
EVER
FINELY
GRAVELLED
AND
NO
GRASS
BECAUSE
OF
GOING
WET
IN
MANY
OF
THESE
ALLEYS
LIKEWISE
YOU
ARE
TO
SET
FRUIT
TREES
OF
ALL
SORTS
AS
WELL
UPON
THE
WALLS
AS
IN
RANGES
AND
THIS
WOULD
BE
GENERALLY
OBSERVED
THAT
THE
BORDERS
WHEREIN
YOU
PLANT
YOUR
FRUIT
TREES
BE
FAIR
AND
LARGE
AND
LOW
AND
NOT
STEEP
AND
SET
WITH
FINE
FLOWERS
BUT
THIN
AND
SPARINGLY
LEST
THEY
DECEIVE
THE
TREES
AT
THE
END
OF
BOTH
THE
SIDE
GROUNDS
WOULD
HAVE
MOUNT
OF
SOME
PRETTY
HEIGHT
LEAVING
THE
WALL
OF
THE
ENCLOSURE
BREAST
HIGH
TO
LOOK
ABROAD
INTO
THE
FIELDS
FOR
THE
MAIN
GARDEN
DO
NOT
DENY
BUT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
SOME
FAIR
ALLEYS
RANGED
ON
BOTH
SIDES
WITH
FRUIT
TREES
AND
SOME
PRETTY
TUFTS
OF
FRUIT
TREES
AND
ARBORS
WITH
SEATS
SET
IN
SOME
DECENT
ORDER
BUT
THESE
TO
BE
BY
NO
MEANS
SET
TOO
THICK
BUT
TO
LEAVE
THE
MAIN
GARDEN
SO
AS
IT
BE
NOT
CLOSE
BUT
THE
AIR
OPEN
AND
FREE
FOR
AS
FOR
SHADE
WOULD
HAVE
YOU
REST
UPON
THE
ALLEYS
OF
THE
SIDE
GROUNDS
THERE
TO
WALK
IF
YOU
BE
DISPOSED
IN
THE
HEAT
OF
THE
YEAR
OR
DAY
BUT
TO
MAKE
ACCOUNT
THAT
THE
MAIN
GARDEN
IS
FOR
THE
MORE
TEMPERATE
PARTS
OF
THE
YEAR
AND
IN
THE
HEAT
OF
SUMMER
FOR
THE
MORNING
AND
THE
EVENING
OR
OVERCAST
DAYS
FOR
AVIARIES
LIKE
THEM
NOT
EXCEPT
THEY
BE
OF
THAT
LARGENESS
AS
THEY
MAY
BE
TURFED
AND
HAVE
LIVING
PLANTS
AND
BUSHES
SET
IN
THEM
THAT
THE
BIRDS
MAY
HAVE
MORE
SCOPE
AND
NATURAL
NESTING
AND
THAT
NO
FOULNESS
APPEAR
IN
THE
FLOOR
OF
THE
AVIARY
SO
HAVE
MADE
PLATFORM
OF
PRINCELY
GARDEN
PARTLY
BY
PRECEPT
PARTLY
BY
DRAWING
NOT
MODEL
BUT
SOME
GENERAL
LINES
OF
IT
AND
IN
THIS
HAVE
SPARED
FOR
NO
COST
BUT
IT
IS
NOTHING
FOR
GREAT
PRINCES
THAT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
TAKING
ADVICE
WITH
WORKMEN
WITH
NO
LESS
COST
SET
THEIR
THINGS
TOGETHER
AND
SOMETIMES
ADD
STATUAS
AND
SUCH
THINGS
FOR
STATE
AND
MAGNIFICENCE
BUT
NOTHING
TO
THE
TRUE
PLEASURE
OF
GARDEN
OF
NEGOTIATING
IT
IS
GENERALLY
BETTER
TO
DEAL
BY
SPEECH
THAN
BY
LETTER
AND
BY
THE
MEDIATION
OF
THIRD
THAN
BY
MAN
SELF
LETTERS
ARE
GOOD
WHEN
MAN
WOULD
DRAW
AN
ANSWER
BY

BACK
AGAIN
OR
WHEN
IT
MAY
SERVE
FOR
MAN
JUSTIFICATION
AFTERWARDS
TO
PRODUCE
HIS
OWN
LETTER
OR
WHERE
IT
MAY
BE
DANGER
TO
BE
INTERRUPTED
OR
HEARD
BY
PIECES
TO
DEAL
IN
PERSON
IS
GOOD
WHEN
MAN
FACE
BREEDETH
REGARD
AS
COMMONLY
WITH
INFERIORS
OR
IN
TENDER
CASES
WHERE
MAN
EYE
UPON
THE
COUNTENANCE
OF
HIM
WITH
WHOM
HE
SPEAKETH
MAY
GIVE
HIM
DIRECTION
HOW
FAR
TO
GO
AND
GENERALLY
WHERE
MAN
WILL
RESERVE
TO
HIMSELF
LIBERTY
EITHER
TO
DISAVOW
OR
TO
EXPOUND
IN
CHOICE
OF
INSTRUMENTS
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
CHOOSE
MEN
OF
PLAINER
SORT
THAT
ARE
LIKE
TO
DO
THAT
THAT
IS
COMMITTED
TO
THEM
AND
TO
REPORT
BACK
AGAIN
FAITHFULLY
THE
SUCCESS
THAN
THOSE
THAT
ARE
CUNNING
TO
CONTRIVE

OF
OTHER

SOMEWHAT
TO

THEMSELVES
AND
WILL

THE

IN

SAKE
USE
ALSO
SUCH

AS
AFFECT
THE

WHEREIN
THEY
ARE
EMPLOYED
FOR
THAT
QUICKENETH
MUCH
AND
SUCH
AS
ARE

AS
BOLD

FOR

FAIR
SPOKEN
MEN
FOR
PERSUASION
CRAFTY
MEN
FOR
INQUIRY
AND
OBSERVATION
FROWARD
AND
ABSURD
MEN
FOR

THAT
DOTH
NOT

BEAR
OUT
ITSELF
USE
ALSO
SUCH
AS
HAVE
BEEN
LUCKY
AND
PREVAILED
BEFORE
IN
THINGS
WHEREIN
YOU
HAVE
EMPLOYED
THEM
FOR
THAT
BREEDS
CONFIDENCE
AND
THEY
WILL
STRIVE
TO
MAINTAIN
THEIR
PRESCRIPTION
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
SOUND
PERSON
WITH
WHOM
ONE
DEALS
AFAR
OFF
THAN
TO
FALL
UPON
THE
POINT
AT
FIRST
EXCEPT
YOU
MEAN
TO
SURPRISE
HIM
BY
SOME
SHORT
QUESTION
IT
IS
BETTER
DEALING
WITH
MEN
IN
APPETITE
THAN
WITH
THOSE
THAT
ARE
WHERE
THEY
WOULD
BE
IF
MAN
DEAL
WITH
ANOTHER
UPON
CONDITIONS
THE
START
OR
FIRST
PERFORMANCE
IS
ALL
WHICH
MAN
CANNOT
REASONABLY
DEMAND
EXCEPT
EITHER
THE
NATURE
OF
THE

BE
SUCH
WHICH
MUST
GO
BEFORE
OR

MAN
CAN
PERSUADE
THE
OTHER
PARTY
THAT
HE
SHALL
STILL
NEED
HIM
IN
SOME
OTHER

OR

THAT
HE
BE
COUNTED
THE
HONESTER
MAN
ALL
PRACTICE
IS
TO
DISCOVER

TO
WORK
MEN
DISCOVER
THEMSELVES
IN
TRUST
IN
PASSION
AT
UNAWARES
AND
OF
NECESSITY
WHEN
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
SOMEWHAT
DONE
AND
CANNOT
FIND
AN

PRETEXT
IF
YOU
WOULD
WORK
ANY
MAN
YOU
MUST
EITHER
KNOW
HIS
NATURE
AND
FASHIONS
AND
SO
LEAD
HIM
OR
HIS
ENDS
AND
SO
PERSUADE
HIM
OR
HIS
WEAKNESS
AND
DISADVANTAGES
AND
SO
AWE
HIM
OR
THOSE
THAT
HAVE
INTEREST
IN
HIM
AND
SO
GOVERN
HIM
IN
DEALING
WITH
CUNNING
PERSONS
WE
MUST
EVER
CONSIDER
THEIR
ENDS
TO
INTERPRET
THEIR
SPEECHES
AND
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
SAY
LITTLE
TO
THEM
AND
THAT
WHICH
THEY
LEAST
LOOK
FOR
IN
ALL
NEGOTIATIONS
OF
DIFFICULTY
MAN
MAY
NOT
LOOK
TO
SOW
AND
REAP
AT

BUT
MUST
PREPARE
BUSINESS
AND
SO
RIPEN
IT
BY
DEGREES
OF

COSTLY
FOLLOWERS
ARE
NOT

WHILE

HE

HIS

SHORTER
RECKON
TO

COSTLY
NOT

ALONE
WHICH
CHARGE
THE

WHICH
ARE

AND
IMPORTUNE
IN

ORDINARY
FOLLOWERS
OUGHT
TO
CHALLENGE
NO
HIGHER
CONDITIONS
THAN
COUNTENANCE
RECOMMENDATION
AND
PROTECTION
FROM

FACTIOUS
FOLLOWERS
ARE
WORSE
TO
BE
LIKED
WHICH
FOLLOW
NOT
UPON
AFFECTION
TO
HIM
WITH
WHOM
THEY
RANGE
THEMSELVES
BUT
UPON
DISCONTENTMENT
CONCEIVED
AGAINST
SOME

WHEREUPON
COMMONLY
ENSUETH
THAT
ILL
INTELLIGENCE
THAT
WE
MANY

SEE
BETWEEN
GREAT
PERSONAGES
LIKEWISE
GLORIOUS
FOLLOWERS
WHO
MAKE
THEMSELVES
AS
TRUMPETS
OF
THE
COMMENDATION
OF
THOSE
THEY

ARE
FULL
OF
INCONVENIENCE
FOR
THEY
TAINT
BUSINESS
THROUGH
WANT
OF
SECRECY
AND
THEY
EXPORT
HONOR
FROM
MAN
AND
MAKE
HIM
RETURN
IN
ENVY
THERE
IS
KIND
OF
FOLLOWERS
LIKEWISE
WHICH
ARE
DANGEROUS
BEING
INDEED
ESPIALS
WHICH
INQUIRE
THE
SECRETS
OF
THE
HOUSE
AND
BEAR
TALES
OF
THEM
TO
OTHERS
YET
SUCH
MEN
MANY

ARE
IN
GREAT

FOR
THEY
ARE
OFFICIOUS
AND
COMMONLY

THE

BY

EVEN
IN

SO
IT
BE
WITHOUT
TOO
MUCH

BUT
THE
MOST

KIND
OF

IS
TO

AS

THAT
APPREHENDETH
TO

VIRTUE
AND

IN
ALL
SORTS
OF

AND
YET
WHERE
THERE
IS
NO
EMINENT

IN

IT
IS
BETTER
TO

WITH

THAN
WITH
THE

ABLE
AND
BESIDES
TO
SPEAK
TRUTH
IN
BASE
TIMES
ACTIVE
MEN
ARE
OF

VIRTUOUS
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
IN

IT
IS
GOOD
TO
USE
MEN
OF

RANK
EQUALLY
FOR
TO

SOME
EXTRAORDINARILY
IS
TO
MAKE

INSOLENT
AND
THE
REST
DISCONTENT
BECAUSE
THEY
MAY
CLAIM

BUT
CONTRARIWISE
IN

TO
USE
MEN
WITH
MUCH

AND

IS
GOOD
FOR
IT
MAKETH
THE

PREFERRED
MORE
THANKFUL
AND
THE

BECAUSE
ALL
IS

IT
IS
GOOD
DISCRETION
NOT
TO

TOO
MUCH
OF

MAN
AT
THE
FIRST
BECAUSE
ONE
CANNOT
HOLD
OUT
THAT
PROPORTION
TO
BE
GOVERNED
AS
WE
CALL
IT
BY

IS
NOT
SAFE
FOR
IT
SHOWS
SOFTNESS
AND
GIVES
FREEDOM
TO

FOR
THOSE
THAT

IMMEDIATELY

OF
THOSE
THAT
ARE
SO
GREAT
WITH

AND
THEREBY
WOUND
THEIR

TO

WITH

IS

FOR

IN

IT
IS

OUT

THERE
ARE
NO

FOR

THEIR

USE

TO

BY

IS
THE

THEY

THEREFORE
IF

HE

NAY
THERE

BOWLING

GENTLE

SO
IF

LET

FOR

IF

NEVER

IF

LET

STUDY
THE

IF

AND
TO
CALL

TO

LET

STUDY
THE

CASES
SO
EVERY
DEFECT
OF
THE

MAY
HAVE
SPECIAL

OF

MANY
HAVE
AN
OPINION
NOT

THAT
FOR
PRINCE
TO
GOVERN
HIS

OR
FOR
GREAT
PERSON
TO
GOVERN
HIS
PROCEEDINGS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
RESPECT
OF
FACTIONS
IS
PRINCIPAL
PART
OF
POLICY
WHEREAS
CONTRARIWISE
THE
CHIEFEST
WISDOM
IS
EITHER
IN
ORDERING
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
GENERAL
AND
WHEREIN
MEN
OF
SEVERAL
FACTIONS
DO
NEVERTHELESS
AGREE
OR
IN
DEALING
WITH

TO
PARTICULAR
PERSONS
ONE
BY

BUT
SAY
NOT
THAT
THE
CONSIDERATIONS
OF
FACTIONS
IS
TO
BE
NEGLECTED
MEAN
MEN
IN
THEIR
RISING
MUST
ADHERE
BUT
GREAT
MEN
THAT
HAVE
STRENGTH
IN
THEMSELVES
WERE
BETTER
TO
MAINTAIN
THEMSELVES
INDIFFERENT
AND
NEUTRAL
YET
EVEN
IN

TO
ADHERE
SO
MODERATELY
AS
HE
BE
MAN
OF
THE
ONE
FACTION
WHICH
IS
MOST
PASSABLE
WITH
THE
OTHER
COMMONLY
GIVETH
BEST
WAY
THE
LOWER
AND
WEAKER
FACTION
IS
THE
FIRMER
IN
CONJUNCTION
AND
IT
IS
OFTEN
SEEN
THAT
FEW
THAT
ARE
STIFF
DO
TIRE
OUT
GREATER
NUMBER
THAT
ARE
MORE
MODERATE
WHEN
ONE
OF
THE
FACTIONS
IS
EXTINGUISHED
THE
REMAINING
SUBDIVIDETH
AS
THE
FACTION
BETWEEN
LUCULLUS
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
NOBLES
OF
THE
SENATE
WHICH
THEY
CALLED
OPTIMATES
HELD
OUT
AWHILE
AGAINST
THE
FACTION
OF
POMPEY
AND
CAESAR
BUT
WHEN
THE
SENATE
AUTHORITY
WAS
PULLED
DOWN
CAESAR
AND
POMPEY
SOON
AFTER
BRAKE
THE
FACTION
OR
PARTY
OF
ANTONIUS
AND
OCTAVIANUS
CAESAR
AGAINST
BRUTUS
AND

HELD
OUT
LIKEWISE
FOR

BUT
WHEN
BRUTUS
AND
CASSIUS
WERE
OVERTHROWN
THEN
SOON
AFTER
ANTONIUS
AND
OCTAVIANUS
BRAKE
AND
SUBDIVIDED
THESE
EXAMPLES
ARE
OF

BUT
THE
SAME
HOLDETH
IN
PRIVATE
FACTIONS
AND
THEREFORE
THOSE
THAT
ARE
SECONDS
IN
FACTIONS
DO
MANY
TIMES
WHEN
THE
FACTION
SUBDIVIDETH
PROVE
PRINCIPALS
BUT
MANY
TIMES
ALSO
THEY
PROVE
CIPHERS
AND
CASHIERED
FOR
MANY
MAN
STRENGTH
IS
IN
OPPOSITION
AND
WHEN
THAT
FAILETH
HE
GROWETH
OUT
OF
USE
IT
IS
COMMONLY
SEEN
THAT
MEN
ONCE
PLACED
TAKE
IN
WITH
THE
CONTRARY
FACTION
TO
THAT
BY
WHICH
THEY
ENTER
THINKING
BELIKE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THE
FIRST
SURE
AND
NOW
ARE
READY
FOR
NEW
PURCHASE
THE
TRAITOR
IN
FACTION
LIGHTLY
GOETH
AWAY
WITH
IT
FOR
WHEN
MATTERS
HAVE
STUCK
LONG
IN
BALANCING
THE
WINNING
OF
SOME
ONE
MAN
CASTETH
THEM
AND
HE
GETTETH
ALL
THE
THANKS
THE
EVEN
CARRIAGE
BETWEEN
TWO
FACTIONS
PROCEEDETH
NOT
ALWAYS
OF
MODERATION
BUT
OF
TRUENESS
TO
MAN
SELF
WITH
END
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
BOTH
CERTAINLY
IN
ITALY
THEY
HOLD
IT
LITTLE
SUSPECT
IN
POPES
WHEN
THEY
HAVE
OFTEN
IN
THEIR
MOUTH
PADRE
COMMUNE
AND
TAKE
IT
TO
BE
SIGN
OF
ONE
THAT
MEANETH
TO
REFER
ALL
TO
THE
GREATNESS
OF
HIS
OWN
HOUSE
KINGS
HAD
NEED
BEWARE
HOW
THEY
SIDE
THEMSELVES
AND
MAKE
THEMSELVES
AS
OF
FACTION
OR
PARTY
FOR
LEAGUES
WITHIN
THE
STATE
ARE
EVER
PERNICIOUS
TO
MONARCHIES
FOR
THEY
RAISE
AN
OBLIGATION
PARAMOUNT
TO
OBLIGATION
OF
SOVEREIGNTY
AND
MAKE
THE
KING
TANQUAM
UNUS
EX
NOBIS
AS
WAS
TO
BE
SEEN
IN
THE
LEAGUE
OF
FRANCE
WHEN
FACTIONS
ARE
CARRIED
TOO
HIGH
AND
TOO
VIOLENTLY
IT
IS
SIGN
OF
WEAKNESS
IN
PRINCES
AND
MUCH
TO
THE
PREJUDICE
BOTH
OF
THEIR
AUTHORITY
AND
BUSINESS
THE
MOTIONS
OF
FACTIONS
UNDER
KINGS
OUGHT
TO
BE
LIKE
THE
MOTIONS
AS
THE
ASTRONOMERS
SPEAK
OF
THE
INFERIOR
ORBS
WHICH
MAY
HAVE
THEIR
PROPER
MOTIONS
BUT
YET
STILL
ARE
QUIETLY
CARRIED
BY
THE
HIGHER
MOTION
OF
PRIMUM
MOBILE
OF
CEREMONIES
AND
RESPECTS
HE
THAT
IS
ONLY
REAL
HAD
NEED
HAVE
EXCEEDING
GREAT
PARTS
OF
VIRTUE
AS
THE
STONE
HAD
NEED
TO
BE
RICH
THAT
IS
SET
WITHOUT
FOIL
BUT
IF
MAN
MARK
IT
WELL
IT
IS
IN
PRAISE
AND
COMMENDATION
OF
MEN
AS
IT
IS
IN
GETTINGS
AND
GAINS
FOR
THE
PROVERB
IS
TRUE
THAT
LIGHT
GAINS
MAKE
HEAVY
PURSES
FOR
LIGHT
GAINS
COME
THICK
WHEREAS
GREAT
COME
BUT
NOW
AND
THEN
SO
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
SMALL
MATTERS
WIN
GREAT
COMMENDATION
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
CONTINUALLY
IN
USE
AND
IN
NOTE
WHEREAS
THE
OCCASION
OF
ANY
GREAT
VIRTUE
COMETH
BUT
ON
FESTIVALS
THEREFORE
IT
DOTH
MUCH
ADD
TO
MAN
REPUTATION
AND
IS
AS
QUEEN
ISABELLA
SAID
LIKE
PERPETUAL
LETTERS
COMMENDATORY
TO
HAVE
GOOD
FORMS
TO
ATTAIN
THEM
IT
ALMOST
SUFFICETH
NOT
TO
DESPISE
THEM
FOR
SO
SHALL
MAN
OBSERVE
THEM
IN
OTHERS
AND
LET
HIM
TRUST
HIMSELF
WITH
THE
REST
FOR
IF
HE
LABOR
TOO
MUCH
TO
EXPRESS
THEM
HE
SHALL
LOSE
THEIR
GRACE
WHICH
IS
TO
BE
NATURAL
AND
UNAFFECTED
SOME
MEN
BEHAVIOR
IS
LIKE
VERSE
WHEREIN
EVERY
SYLLABLE
IS
MEASURED
HOW
CAN
MAN
COMPREHEND
GREAT
MATTERS
THAT
BREAKETH
HIS
MIND
TOO
MUCH
TO
SMALL
OBSERVATIONS
NOT
TO
USE
CEREMONIES
AT
ALL
IS
TO
TEACH
OTHERS
NOT
TO
USE
THEM
AGAIN
AND
SO
DIMINISHETH
RESPECT
TO
HIMSELF
ESPECIALLY
THEY
BE
NOT
TO
BE
OMITTED
TO
STRANGERS
AND
FORMAL
NATURES
BUT
THE
DWELLING
UPON
THEM
AND
EXALTING
THEM
ABOVE
THE
MOON
IS
NOT
ONLY
TEDIOUS
BUT
DOTH
DIMINISH
THE
FAITH
AND
CREDIT
OF
HIM
THAT
SPEAKS
AND
CERTAINLY
THERE
IS
KIND
OF
CONVEYING
OF
EFFECTUAL
AND
IMPRINTING
PASSAGES
AMONGST
COMPLIMENTS
WHICH
IS
OF
SINGULAR
USE
IF
MAN
CAN
HIT
UPON
IT
AMONGST
MAN
PEERS
MAN
SHALL
BE
SURE
OF
FAMILIARITY
AND
THEREFORE
IT
IS
GOOD
LITTLE
TO
KEEP
STATE
AMONGST
MAN
INFERIORS
ONE
SHALL
BE
SURE
OF
REVERENCE
AND
THEREFORE
IT
IS
GOOD
LITTLE
TO
BE
FAMILIAR
HE
THAT
IS
TOO
MUCH
IN
ANYTHING
SO
THAT
HE
GIVETH
ANOTHER
OCCASION
OF
SATIETY
MAKETH
HIMSELF
CHEAP
TO
APPLY
ONE
SELF
TO
OTHERS
IS
GOOD
SO
IT
BE
WITH
DEMONSTRATION
THAT
MAN
DOTH
IT
UPON
REGARD
AND
NOT
UPON
FACILITY
IT
IS
GOOD
PRECEPT
GENERALLY
IN
SECONDING
ANOTHER
YET
TO
ADD
SOMEWHAT
OF

AS
IF
YOU
WILL
GRANT
HIS

LET
IT
BE
WITH
SOME
DISTINCTION
IF

WILL

LET

IF

LET

FOR

THEY
NEVER

OTHERWISE
THEIR
ENVIERS
WILL
BE
SURE
TO
GIVE
THEM
THAT
ATTRIBUTE
TO
THE
DISADVANTAGE
OF
THEIR

VIRTUES
IT
IS
LOSS
ALSO
IN

TO
BE
TOO
FULL
OF

TO
BE
CURIOUS
IN

SOLOMON

IT

HOW

THERE

TO

UPON
THE
EFFECTS
OF

HOW
IT
TROUBLES

AND
THE
BEST

TO
DO
THIS
IS
TO
LOOK
BACK
UPON

WHEN
THE

THAT
ANGER
IS

ANGER

IN
THE

OF
THOSE

IN
WHOM
IT
REIGNS
CHILDREN
WOMEN
OLD
FOLKS
SICK
FOLKS
ONLY
MEN
MUST
BEWARE
THAT
THEY
CARRY
THEIR
ANGER
RATHER
WITH
SCORN
THAN
WITH
FEAR
SO
THAT
THEY
MAY
SEEM
RATHER
TO
BE
ABOVE
THE
INJURY
THAN
BELOW
IT
WHICH
IS
THING
EASILY
DONE
IF
MAN
WILL
GIVE

TO

IN
IT
FOR

THE
CAUSES

CHIEFLY
THREE
FIRST
TO

OF

FOR
NO
MAN
IS
ANGRY
THAT
FEELS
NOT
HIMSELF
HURT
AND
THEREFORE
TENDER

DELICATE
PERSONS
MUST
NEEDS
BE
OFT
ANGRY
THEY
HAVE
SO
MANY
THINGS
TO

THEM
WHICH
MORE

THE

FOR

IS
THAT
WHICH
PUTTETH
AN
EDGE
UPON

AS

OR
MORE
THAN
THE
HURT
ITSELF
AND
THEREFORE
WHEN
MEN
ARE
INGENIOUS
IN

THEY
DO
KINDLE
THEIR
ANGER
MUCH
LASTLY
OPINION

WHEREIN
THE

IS
THAT

SHOULD
HAVE
AS
CONSALVO
WAS
WONT
TO
SAY
TELAM
HONORIS
CRASSIOREM
BUT
IN
ALL
REFRAININGS
OF
ANGER
IT
IS
THE
BEST
REMEDY
TO
WIN
TIME
AND
TO
MAKE
MAN
SELF
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
OPPORTUNITY
OF
HIS
REVENGE
IS
NOT

COME
BUT
THAT
HE
FORESEES
TIME
FOR
IT
AND
SO
TO
STILL
HIMSELF
IN
THE
MEANTIME
AND
RESERVE
IT
TO
CONTAIN
ANGER
FROM
MISCHIEF
THOUGH
IT
TAKE
HOLD
OF
MAN
THERE
BE
TWO
THINGS
WHEREOF
YOU
MUST
HAVE
SPECIAL
CAUTION
THE
ONE
OF
EXTREME
BITTERNESS
OF
WORDS
ESPECIALLY
IF
THEY
BE
ACULEATE
AND
PROPER
FOR

ARE
NOTHING
SO

AND
AGAIN
THAT
IN

MAN
REVEAL
NO

FOR

FOR

THE
OTHER
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT

BREAK
OFF
IN

IN

OF

BUT
HOWSOEVER
YOU
SHOW
BITTERNESS
DO

THAT
IS
NOT
REVOCABLE
FOR
RAISING
AND
APPEASING
ANGER
IN
ANOTHER
IT
IS
DONE
CHIEFLY
BY
CHOOSING
OF
TIMES
WHEN
MEN
ARE
FROWARDEST
AND
WORST
DISPOSED
TO
INCENSE
THEM
AGAIN
BY
GATHERING
AS
WAS
TOUCHED
BEFORE
ALL
THAT
YOU
CAN
FIND
OUT
TO
AGGRAVATE
THE
CONTEMPT
AND
THE
TWO
REMEDIES
ARE
BY
THE
CONTRARIES
THE
FORMER
TO
TAKE
GOOD
TIMES
WHEN
FIRST
TO
RELATE
TO
MAN
AN
ANGRY
BUSINESS
FOR
THE
FIRST
IMPRESSION
IS
MUCH
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
TO
SEVER
AS
MUCH
AS
MAY
BE
THE
CONSTRUCTION
OF
THE
INJURY
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
CONTEMPT
IMPUTING
IT
TO
MISUNDERSTANDING
FEAR
PASSION
OR
WHAT
YOU
WILL
OF
VICISSITUDE
OF
THINGS
SOLOMON
SAITH
THERE
IS
NO
NEW
THING
UPON
THE
EARTH
SO
THAT
AS
PLATO
HAD
AN
IMAGINATION
THAT
ALL
KNOWLEDGE
WAS
BUT
REMEMBRANCE
SO
SOLOMON
GIVETH
HIS
SENTENCE
THAT
ALL
NOVELTY
IS
BUT
OBLIVION
WHEREBY
YOU
MAY
SEE
THAT
THE
RIVER
OF
LETHE
RUNNETH
AS
WELL
ABOVE
GROUND
AS
BELOW
THERE
IS
AN
ABSTRUSE
ASTROLOGER
THAT
SAITH
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
FOR
TWO
THINGS
THAT
ARE
CONSTANT
THE
ONE
IS
THAT
THE
FIXED
STARS
EVER
STAND
LIKE
DISTANCE
ONE
FROM
ANOTHER
AND
NEVER
COME
NEARER
TOGETHER
NOR
GO
FURTHER
ASUNDER
THE
OTHER
THAT
THE
DIURNAL
MOTION
PERPETUALLY
KEEPETH
TIME
NO
INDIVIDUAL
WOULD
LAST
ONE
MOMENT
CERTAIN
IT
IS
THAT
THE
MATTER
IS
IN
PERPETUAL
FLUX
AND
NEVER
AT
STAY
THE
GREAT
WINDING
SHEETS
THAT
BURY
ALL
THINGS
IN
OBLIVION
ARE
TWO
DELUGES
AND
EARTHQUAKES
AS
FOR
CONFLAGRATIONS
AND
GREAT
DROUGHTS
THEY
DO
NOT
MERELY
DISPEOPLE
AND
DESTROY
PHAETON
CAR
WENT
BUT
DAY
AND
THE
THREE
YEARS
DROUGHT
IN
THE
TIME
OF
ELIAS
WAS
BUT
PARTICULAR
AND
LEFT
PEOPLE
ALIVE
AS
FOR
THE
GREAT
BURNINGS
BY
LIGHTNINGS
WHICH
ARE
OFTEN
IN
THE
WEST
INDIES
THEY
ARE
BUT
NARROW
BUT
IN
THE
OTHER
TWO
DESTRUCTIONS
BY
DELUGE
AND
EARTHQUAKE
IT
IS
FURTHER
TO
BE
NOTED
THAT
THE
REMNANT
OF
PEOPLE
WHICH
HAP
TO
BE
RESERVED
ARE
COMMONLY
IGNORANT
AND
MOUNTAINOUS
PEOPLE
THAT
CAN
GIVE
NO
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
TIME
PAST
SO
THAT
THE
OBLIVION
IS
ALL
ONE
AS
IF
NONE
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
IF
YOU
CONSIDER
WELL
OF
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
WEST
INDIES
IT
IS
VERY
PROBABLE
THAT
THEY
ARE
NEWER
OR
YOUNGER
PEOPLE
THAN
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
OLD
WORLD
AND
IT
IS
MUCH
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
THE
DESTRUCTION
THAT
HATH
HERETOFORE
BEEN
THERE
WAS
NOT
BY
EARTHQUAKES
AS
THE
EGYPTIAN
PRIEST
TOLD
SOLON
CONCERNING
THE
ISLAND
OF
ATLANTIS
THAT
IT
WAS
SWALLOWED
BY
AN
EARTHQUAKE
BUT
RATHER
THAT
IT
WAS
DESOLATED
BY
PARTICULAR
DELUGE
FOR
EARTHQUAKES
ARE
SELDOM
IN
THOSE
PARTS
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
THEY
HAVE
SUCH
POURING
RIVERS
AS
THE
RIVERS
OF
ASIA
AND
AFRICK
AND
EUROPE
ARE
BUT
BROOKS
TO
THEM
THEIR
ANDES
LIKEWISE
OR
MOUNTAINS
ARE
FAR
HIGHER
THAN
THOSE
WITH
US
WHEREBY
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
REMNANTS
OF
GENERATION
OF
MEN
WERE
IN
SUCH
PARTICULAR
DELUGE
SAVED
AS
FOR
THE
OBSERVATION
THAT
MACHIAVEL
HATH
THAT
THE
JEALOUSY
OF
SECTS
DOTH
MUCH
EXTINGUISH
THE
MEMORY
OF
THINGS
TRADUCING
GREGORY
THE
GREAT
THAT
HE
DID
WHAT
IN
HIM
LAY
TO
EXTINGUISH
ALL
HEATHEN
ANTIQUITIES
DO
NOT
FIND
THAT
THOSE
ZEALS
DO
ANY
GREAT
EFFECTS
NOR
LAST
LONG
AS
IT
APPEARED
IN
THE
SUCCESSION
OF
SABINIAN
WHO
DID
REVIVE
THE
FORMER
ANTIQUITIES
THE
VICISSITUDE
OF
MUTATIONS
IN
THE
SUPERIOR
GLOBE
ARE
NO
FIT
MATTER
FOR
THIS
PRESENT
ARGUMENT
IT
MAY
BE
PLATO
GREAT
YEAR
IF
THE
WORLD
SHOULD
LAST
SO
LONG
WOULD
HAVE
SOME
EFFECT
NOT
IN
RENEWING
THE
STATE
OF
LIKE
INDIVIDUALS
FOR
THAT
IS
THE
FUME
OF
THOSE
THAT
CONCEIVE
THE
CELESTIAL
BODIES
HAVE
MORE
ACCURATE
INFLUENCES
UPON
THESE
THINGS
BELOW
THAN
INDEED
THEY
HAVE
BUT
IN
GROSS
COMETS
OUT
OF
QUESTION
HAVE
LIKEWISE
POWER
AND
EFFECT
OVER
THE
GROSS
AND
MASS
OF
THINGS
BUT
THEY
ARE
RATHER
GAZED
UPON
AND
WAITED
UPON
IN
THEIR
JOURNEY
THAN
WISELY
OBSERVED
IN
THEIR
EFFECTS
SPECIALLY
IN
THEIR
RESPECTIVE
EFFECTS
THAT
IS
WHAT
KIND
OF
COMET
FOR
MAGNITUDE
COLOR
VERSION
OF
THE
BEAMS
PLACING
IN
THE
REIGN
OF
HEAVEN
OR
LASTING
PRODUCETH
WHAT
KIND
OF
EFFECTS
THERE
IS
TOY
WHICH
HAVE
HEARD
AND
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
IT
GIVEN
OVER
BUT
WAITED
UPON
LITTLE
THEY
SAY
IT
IS
OBSERVED
IN
THE
LOW
COUNTRIES
KNOW
NOT
IN
WHAT
PART
THAT
EVERY
FIVE
AND
THIRTY
YEARS
THE
SAME
KIND
AND
SUIT
OF
YEARS
AND
WEATHERS
COME
ABOUT
AGAIN
AS
GREAT
FROSTS
GREAT
WET
GREAT
DROUGHTS
WARM
WINTERS
SUMMERS
WITH
LITTLE
HEAT
AND
THE
LIKE
AND
THEY
CALL
IT
THE
PRIME
IT
IS
THING
DO
THE
RATHER
MENTION
BECAUSE
COMPUTING
BACKWARDS
HAVE
FOUND
SOME
CONCURRENCE
BUT
TO
LEAVE
THESE
POINTS
OF
NATURE
AND
TO
COME
TO
MEN
THE
GREATEST
VICISSITUDE
OF
THINGS
AMONGST
MEN
IS
THE
VICISSITUDE
OF
SECTS
AND
RELIGIONS
FOR
THOSE
ORBS
RULE
IN
MEN
MINDS
MOST
THE
TRUE
RELIGION
IS
BUILT
UPON
THE
ROCK
THE
REST
ARE
TOSSED
UPON
THE
WAVES
OF
TIME
TO
SPEAK
THEREFORE
OF
THE
CAUSES
OF
NEW
SECTS
AND
TO
GIVE
SOME
COUNSEL
CONCERNING
THEM
AS
FAR
AS
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
HUMAN
JUDGMENT
CAN
GIVE
STAY
TO
SO
GREAT
REVOLUTIONS
WHEN
THE
RELIGION
FORMERLY
RECEIVED
IS
RENT
BY
DISCORDS
AND
WHEN
THE
HOLINESS
OF
THE
PROFESSORS
OF
RELIGION
IS
DECAYED
AND
FULL
OF
SCANDAL
AND
WITHAL
THE
TIMES
BE
STUPID
IGNORANT
AND
BARBAROUS
YOU
MAY
DOUBT
THE
SPRINGING
UP
OF
NEW
SECT
IF
THEN
ALSO
THERE
SHOULD
ARISE
ANY
EXTRAVAGANT
AND
STRANGE
SPIRIT
TO
MAKE
HIMSELF
AUTHOR
THEREOF
ALL
WHICH
POINTS
HELD
WHEN
MAHOMET
PUBLISHED
HIS
LAW
IF
NEW
SECT
HAVE
NOT
TWO
PROPERTIES
FEAR
IT
NOT
FOR
IT
WILL
NOT
SPREAD
THE
ONE
IS
THE
SUPPLANTING
OR
THE
OPPOSING
OF
AUTHORITY
ESTABLISHED
FOR
NOTHING
IS
MORE
POPULAR
THAN
THAT
THE
OTHER
IS
THE
GIVING
LICENSE
TO
PLEASURES
AND
VOLUPTUOUS
LIFE
FOR
AS
FOR
SPECULATIVE
HERESIES
SUCH
AS
WERE
IN
ANCIENT
TIMES
THE
ARIANS
AND
NOW
THE
ARMINIANS
THOUGH
THEY
WORK
MIGHTILY
UPON
MEN
WITS
YET
THEY
DO
NOT
PRODUCE
ANY
GREAT
ALTERATIONS
IN
STATES
EXCEPT
IT
BE
BY
THE
HELP
OF
CIVIL
OCCASIONS
THERE
BE
THREE
MANNER
OF
PLANTATIONS
OF
NEW
SECTS
BY
THE
POWER
OF
SIGNS
AND
MIRACLES
BY
THE
ELOQUENCE
AND
WISDOM
OF
SPEECH
AND
PERSUASION
AND
BY
THE
SWORD
FOR
MARTYRDOMS
RECKON
THEM
AMONGST
MIRACLES
BECAUSE
THEY
SEEM
TO
EXCEED
THE
STRENGTH
OF
HUMAN
NATURE
AND
MAY
DO
THE
LIKE
OF
SUPERLATIVE
AND
ADMIRABLE
HOLINESS
OF
LIFE
SURELY
THERE
IS
NO
BETTER
WAY
TO
STOP
THE
RISING
OF
NEW
SECTS
AND
SCHISMS
THAN
TO
REFORM
ABUSES
TO
COMPOUND
THE
SMALLER
DIFFERENCES
TO
PROCEED
MILDLY
AND
NOT
WITH
SANGUINARY
PERSECUTIONS
AND
RATHER
TO
TAKE
OFF
THE
PRINCIPAL
AUTHORS
BY
WINNING
AND
ADVANCING
THEM
THAN
TO
ENRAGE
THEM
BY
VIOLENCE
AND
BITTERNESS
THE
CHANGES
AND
VICISSITUDE
IN
WARS
ARE
MANY
BUT
CHIEFLY
IN
THREE
THINGS
IN
THE
SEATS
OR
STAGES
OF
THE
WAR
IN
THE
WEAPONS
AND
IN
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
CONDUCT
WARS
IN
ANCIENT
TIME
SEEMED
MORE
TO
MOVE
FROM
EAST
TO
WEST
FOR
THE
PERSIANS
ASSYRIANS
ARABIANS
TARTARS
WHICH
WERE
THE
INVADERS
WERE
ALL
EASTERN
PEOPLE
IT
IS
TRUE
THE
GAULS
WERE
WESTERN
BUT
WE
READ
BUT
OF
TWO
INCURSIONS
OF
THEIRS
THE
ONE
TO
GALLO
GRECIA
THE
OTHER
TO
ROME
BUT
EAST
AND
WEST
HAVE
NO
CERTAIN
POINTS
OF
HEAVEN
AND
NO
MORE
HAVE
THE
WARS
EITHER
FROM
THE
EAST
OR
WEST
ANY
CERTAINTY
OF
OBSERVATION
BUT
NORTH
AND
SOUTH
ARE
FIXED
AND
IT
HATH
SELDOM
OR
NEVER
BEEN
SEEN
THAT
THE
FAR
SOUTHERN
PEOPLE
HAVE
INVADED
THE
NORTHERN
BUT
CONTRARIWISE
WHEREBY
IT
IS
MANIFEST
THAT
THE
NORTHERN
TRACT
OF
THE
WORLD
IS
IN
NATURE
THE
MORE
MARTIAL
REGION
BE
IT
IN
RESPECT
OF
THE
STARS
OF
THAT
HEMISPHERE
OR
OF
THE
GREAT
CONTINENTS
THAT
ARE
UPON
THE
NORTH
WHEREAS
THE
SOUTH
PART
FOR
AUGHT
THAT
IS
KNOWN
IS
ALMOST
ALL
SEA
OR
WHICH
IS
MOST
APPARENT
OF
THE
COLD
OF
THE
NORTHERN
PARTS
WHICH
IS
THAT
WHICH
WITHOUT
AID
OF
DISCIPLINE
DOTH
MAKE
THE
BODIES
HARDEST
AND
THE
COURAGES
WARMEST
UPON
THE
BREAKING
AND
SHIVERING
OF
GREAT
STATE
AND
EMPIRE
YOU
MAY
BE
SURE
TO
HAVE
WARS
FOR
GREAT
EMPIRES
WHILE
THEY
STAND
DO
ENERVATE
AND
DESTROY
THE
FORCES
OF
THE
NATIVES
WHICH
THEY
HAVE
SUBDUED
RESTING
UPON
THEIR
OWN
PROTECTING
FORCES
AND
THEN
WHEN
THEY
FAIL
ALSO
ALL
GOES
TO
RUIN
AND
THEY
BECOME
PREY
SO
WAS
IT
IN
THE
DECAY
OF
THE
ROMAN
EMPIRE
AND
LIKEWISE
IN
THE
EMPIRE
OF
ALMAIGNE
AFTER
CHARLES
THE
GREAT
EVERY
BIRD
TAKING
FEATHER
AND
WERE
NOT
UNLIKE
TO
BEFALL
TO
SPAIN
IF
IT
SHOULD
BREAK
THE
GREAT
ACCESSIONS
AND
UNIONS
OF
KINGDOMS
DO
LIKEWISE
STIR
UP
WARS
FOR
WHEN
STATE
GROWS
TO
AN
OVER
POWER
IT
IS
LIKE
GREAT
FLOOD
THAT
WILL
BE
SURE
TO
OVERFLOW
AS
IT
HATH
BEEN
SEEN
IN
THE
STATES
OF
ROME
TURKEY
SPAIN
AND
OTHERS
LOOK
WHEN
THE
WORLD
HATH
FEWEST
BARBAROUS
PEOPLES
BUT
SUCH
AS
COMMONLY
WILL
NOT
MARRY
OR
GENERATE
EXCEPT
THEY
KNOW
MEANS
TO
LIVE
AS
IT
IS
ALMOST
EVERYWHERE
AT
THIS
DAY
EXCEPT
TARTARY
THERE
IS
NO
DANGER
OF
INUNDATIONS
OF
PEOPLE
BUT
WHEN
THERE
BE
GREAT
SHOALS
OF
PEOPLE
WHICH
GO
ON
TO
POPULATE
WITHOUT
FORESEEING
MEANS
OF
LIFE
AND
SUSTENTATION
IT
IS
OF
NECESSITY
THAT
ONCE
IN
AN
AGE
OR
TWO
THEY
DISCHARGE
PORTION
OF
THEIR
PEOPLE
UPON
OTHER
NATIONS
WHICH
THE
ANCIENT
NORTHERN
PEOPLE
WERE
WONT
TO
DO
BY
LOT
CASTING
LOTS
WHAT
PART
SHOULD
STAY
AT
HOME
AND
WHAT
SHOULD
SEEK
THEIR
FORTUNES
WHEN
WARLIKE
STATE
GROWS
SOFT
AND
EFFEMINATE
THEY
MAY
BE
SURE
OF
WAR
FOR
COMMONLY
SUCH
STATES
ARE
GROWN
RICH
IN
THE
TIME
OF
THEIR
DEGENERATING
AND
SO
THE
PREY
INVITETH
AND
THEIR
DECAY
IN
VALOR
ENCOURAGETH
WAR
AS
FOR
THE
WEAPONS
IT
HARDLY
FALLETH
UNDER
RULE
AND
OBSERVATION
YET
WE
SEE
EVEN
THEY
HAVE
RETURNS
AND
VICISSITUDES
FOR
CERTAIN
IT
IS
THAT
ORDNANCE
WAS
KNOWN
IN
THE
CITY
OF
THE
OXIDRAKES
IN
INDIA
AND
WAS
THAT
WHICH
THE
MACEDONIANS
CALLED
THUNDER
AND
LIGHTNING
AND
MAGIC
AND
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
THE
USE
OF
ORDNANCE
HATH
BEEN
IN
CHINA
ABOVE
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
THE
CONDITIONS
OF
WEAPONS
AND
THEIR
IMPROVEMENT
ARE
FIRST
THE
FETCHING
AFAR
OFF
FOR
THAT
OUTRUNS
THE
DANGER
AS
IT
IS
SEEN
IN
ORDNANCE
AND
MUSKETS
SECONDLY
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
PERCUSSION
WHEREIN
LIKEWISE
ORDNANCE
DO
EXCEED
ALL
ARIETATIONS
AND
ANCIENT
INVENTIONS
THE
THIRD
IS
THE
COMMODIOUS
USE
OF
THEM
AS
THAT
THEY
MAY
SERVE
IN
ALL
WEATHERS
THAT
THE
CARRIAGE
MAY
BE
LIGHT
AND
MANAGEABLE
AND
THE
LIKE
FOR
THE
CONDUCT
OF
THE
WAR
AT
THE
FIRST
MEN
RESTED
EXTREMELY
UPON
NUMBER
THEY
DID
PUT
THE
WARS
LIKEWISE
UPON
MAIN
FORCE
AND
VALOR
POINTING
DAYS
FOR
PITCHED
FIELDS
AND
SO
TRYING
IT
OUT
UPON
AN
EVEN
MATCH
AND
THEY
WERE
MORE
IGNORANT
IN
RANGING
AND
ARRAYING
THEIR
BATTLES
AFTER
THEY
GREW
TO
REST
UPON
NUMBER
RATHER
COMPETENT
THAN
VAST
THEY
GREW
TO
ADVANTAGES
OF
PLACE
CUNNING
DIVERSIONS
AND
THE
LIKE
AND
THEY
GREW
MORE
SKILFUL
IN
THE
ORDERING
OF
THEIR
BATTLES
IN
THE
YOUTH
OF
STATE
ARMS
DO
FLOURISH
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AGE
OF
STATE
LEARNING
AND
THEN
BOTH
OF
THEM
TOGETHER
FOR
TIME
IN
THE
DECLINING
AGE
OF
STATE
MECHANICAL
ARTS
AND
MERCHANDIZE
LEARNING
HATH
HIS
INFANCY
WHEN
IT
IS
BUT
BEGINNING
AND
ALMOST
CHILDISH
THEN
HIS
YOUTH
WHEN
IT
IS
LUXURIANT
AND
JUVENILE
THEN
HIS
STRENGTH
OF
YEARS
WHEN
IT
IS
SOLID
AND
REDUCED
AND
LASTLY
HIS
OLD
AGE
WHEN
IT
WAXETH
DRY
AND
EXHAUST
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
TO
LOOK
TOO
LONG
UPON
THESE
TURNING
WHEELS
OF
VICISSITUDE
LEST
WE
BECOME
GIDDY
AS
FOR
THE
PHILOLOGY
OF
THEM
THAT
IS
BUT
CIRCLE
OF
TALES
AND
THEREFORE
NOT
FIT
FOR
THIS
WRITING
OF
FAME
THE
POETS
MAKE
FAME
MONSTER
THEY
DESCRIBE
HER
IN
PART
FINELY
AND
ELEGANTLY
AND
IN
PART
GRAVELY
AND
SENTENTIOUSLY
THEY
SAY
LOOK
HOW
MANY
FEATHERS
SHE
HATH
SO
MANY
EYES
SHE
HATH
UNDERNEATH
SO
MANY
TONGUES
SO
MANY
VOICES
SHE
PRICKS
UP
SO
MANY
EARS
THIS
IS
FLOURISH
THERE
FOLLOW
EXCELLENT
PARABLES
AS
THAT
SHE
GATHERETH
STRENGTH
IN
GOING
THAT
SHE
GOETH
UPON
THE
GROUND
AND
YET
HIDETH
HER
HEAD
IN
THE
CLOUDS
THAT
IN
THE
DAYTIME
SHE
SITTETH
IN
WATCH
TOWER
AND
FLIETH
MOST
BY
NIGHT
THAT
SHE
MINGLETH
THINGS
DONE
WITH
THINGS
NOT
DONE
AND
THAT
SHE
IS
TERROR
TO
GREAT
CITIES
BUT
THAT
WHICH
PASSETH
ALL
THE
REST
IS
THEY
DO
RECOUNT
THAT
THE
EARTH
MOTHER
OF
THE
GIANTS
THAT
MADE
WAR
AGAINST
JUPITER
AND
WERE
BY
HIM
DESTROYED
THEREUPON
IN
AN
ANGER
BROUGHT
FORTH
FAME
FOR
CERTAIN
IT
IS
THAT
REBELS
FIGURED
BY
THE
GIANTS
AND
SEDITIOUS
FAMES
AND
LIBELS
ARE
BUT
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
MASCULINE
AND
FEMININE
BUT
NOW
IF
MAN
CAN
TAME
THIS
MONSTER
AND
BRING
HER
TO
FEED
AT
THE
HAND
AND
GOVERN
HER
AND
WITH
HER
FLY
OTHER
RAVENING
FOWL
AND
KILL
THEM
IT
IS
SOMEWHAT
WORTH
BUT
WE
ARE
INFECTED
WITH
THE
STYLE
OF
THE
POETS
TO
SPEAK
NOW
IN
SAD
AND
SERIOUS
MANNER
THERE
IS
NOT
IN
ALL
THE
POLITICS
PLACE
LESS
HANDLED
AND
MORE
WORTHY
TO
BE
HANDLED
THAN
THIS
OF
FAME
WE
WILL
THEREFORE
SPEAK
OF
THESE
POINTS
WHAT
ARE
FALSE
FAMES
AND
WHAT
ARE
TRUE
FAMES
AND
HOW
THEY
MAY
BE
BEST
DISCERNED
HOW
FAMES
MAY
BE
SOWN
AND
RAISED
HOW
THEY
MAY
BE
SPREAD
AND
MULTIPLIED
AND
HOW
THEY
MAY
BE
CHECKED
AND
LAID
DEAD
AND
OTHER
THINGS
CONCERNING
THE
NATURE
OF
FAME
FAME
IS
OF
THAT
FORCE
AS
THERE
IS
SCARCELY
ANY
GREAT
ACTION
WHEREIN
IT
HATH
NOT
GREAT
PART
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
WAR
MUCIANUS
UNDID
VITELLIUS
BY
FAME
THAT
HE
SCATTERED
THAT
VITELLIUS
HAD
IN
PURPOSE
TO
REMOVE
THE
LEGIONS
OF
SYRIA
INTO
GERMANY
AND
THE
LEGIONS
OF
GERMANY
INTO
SYRIA
WHEREUPON
THE
LEGIONS
OF
SYRIA
WERE
INFINITELY
INFLAMED
JULIUS
CAESAR
TOOK
POMPEY
UNPROVIDED
AND
LAID
ASLEEP
HIS
INDUSTRY
AND
PREPARATIONS
BY
FAME
THAT
HE
CUNNINGLY
GAVE
OUT
CAESAR
OWN
SOLDIERS
LOVED
HIM
NOT
AND
BEING
WEARIED
WITH
THE
WARS
AND
LADEN
WITH
THE
SPOILS
OF
GAUL
WOULD
FORSAKE
HIM
AS
SOON
AS
HE
CAME
INTO
ITALY
LIVIA
SETTLED
ALL
THINGS
FOR
THE
SUCCESSION
OF
HER
SON
TIBERIUS
BY
CONTINUAL
GIVING
OUT
THAT
HER
HUSBAND
AUGUSTUS
WAS
UPON
RECOVERY
AND
AMENDMENT
AND
IT
IS
AN
USUAL
THING
WITH
THE
PASHAS
TO
CONCEAL
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
GREAT
TURK
FROM
THE
JANIZARIES
AND
MEN
OF
WAR
TO
SAVE
THE
SACKING
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
AND
OTHER
TOWNS
AS
THEIR
MANNER
IS
THEMISTOCLES
MADE
XERXES
KING
OF
PERSIA
POST
APACE
OUT
OF
GRECIA
BY
GIVING
OUT
THAT
THE
GRECIANS
HAD
PURPOSE
TO
BREAK
HIS
BRIDGE
OF
SHIPS
WHICH
HE
HAD
MADE
ATHWART
HELLESPONT
THERE
BE
THOUSAND
SUCH
LIKE
EXAMPLES
AND
THE
MORE
THEY
ARE
THE
LESS
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
REPEATED
BECAUSE
MAN
MEETETH
WITH
THEM
EVERYWHERE
THEREFORE
LET
ALL
WISE
GOVERNORS
HAVE
AS
GREAT
WATCH
